## Control
Rules  to  control  physical  and  logical  access  to  information  and  other  associated  assets  should  be established and implemented based on business and information security requirements.
## Purpose
To ensure authorized access and to prevent unauthorized access to information and other associated assets.
## Guidance
Owners of information and other associated assets should determine information security and business requirements related to access control. A topic-specific policy on access control should be defined which takes account of these requirements and should be communicated to all relevant interested parties.
These requirements and the topic-specific policy should consider the following:
- a) determining which entities require which type of access to the information and other associated assets;
- b) security of applications (see  );
- c) physical  access,  which  needs  to  be  supported  by  appropriate  physical  entry  controls  (see , ,  );
- d) information  dissemination  and  authorization  (e.g.  the  need-to-know  principle)  and  information security levels and classification of information (see , ,  );
- e) restrictions to privileged access (see  );
- f) segregation of duties (see  );
- g) relevant legislation, regulations and any contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to data or services (see , , , ,  );
- h) segregation of access control functions (e.g. access request, access authorization, access administration);
- i) formal authorization of access requests (see  and  );
- j) the management of access rights (see  );
- k) logging (see ).
Access control rules should be implemented by defining and mapping appropriate access rights and restrictions  to  the  relevant  entities  (see  ).  An  entity  can  represent  a  human  user  as  well  as  a technical or logical item (e.g. a machine, device or a service). To simplify the access control management, specific roles can be assigned to entity groups.
The following should be taken into account when defining and implementing access control rules:
- a) consistency between the access rights and information classification;
- b) consistency between the access rights and the physical perimeter security needs and requirements;
- c) considering  all  types  of  available  connections  in  distributed  environments  so  entities  are  only provided with access to information and other associated assets, including networks and network services, that they are authorized to use;
- d) considering how elements or factors relevant to dynamic access control can be reflected.
## Other information
There are often overarching principles used in the context of access control. Two of the most frequently used principles are:
- a) need-to-know: an entity is only granted access to the information which that entity requires in order to perform its tasks (different tasks or roles mean different need-to-know information and hence different access profiles);
- b) need-to-use: an entity is only assigned access to information technology infrastructure where a clear need is present.
Care should be taken when specifying access control rules to consider:
- a) establishing rules based on the premise of least privilege, 'Everything is generally forbidden unless expressly  permitted',  rather  than  the  weaker  rule,  'Everything  is  generally  permitted  unless expressly forbidden';
- b) changes in information labels (see ) that are initiated automatically by information processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;
- c) changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator;
- d) when to define and regularly review the approval.
Access control rules should be supported by documented procedures (see , , , , , , ,  ) and defined responsibilities (see , ).
There  are  several  ways  to  implement  access  control,  such  as  MAC  (mandatory  access  control), DAC  (discretionary  access  control),  RBAC  (role-based  access  control)  and  ABAC  (attribute-based access control).
Access control rules can also contain dynamic elements (e.g. a function that evaluates past accesses or specific environment values). Access control rules can be implemented in different granularity, ranging from  covering  whole  networks  or  systems  to  specific  data  fields  and  can  also  consider  properties such as user location or the type of network connection that is used for access. These principles and how granular access control is defined can have a significant cost impact. Stronger rules and more granularity typically lead to higher cost. Business requirements and risk considerations should be used to define which access control rules are applied and which granularity is required.
##  Identity management
| Control type   | Information security properties           | Cybersecurity concepts   | Operational capabilities          | Security domains   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| #Preventive    | #Confidentiality #Integrity #Availability | #Protect                 | #Identity_and_ac- cess_management | #Protection        |
## Control
The full life cycle of identities should be managed.
## Purpose
To  allow  for  the  unique  identification  of  individuals  and  systems  accessing  the  organization's information and other associated assets and to enable appropriate assignment of access rights.
## Guidance
The processes used in the context of identity management should ensure that:
- a) for identities assigned to persons, a specific identity is only linked to a single person to be able to hold the person accountable for actions performed with this specific identity;
- b) identities  assigned  to  multiple  persons  (e.g.  shared  identities)  are  only  permitted  where  they are  necessary  for  business  or  operational  reasons  and  are  subject  to  dedicated  approval  and documentation;
- c) identities  assigned  to  non-human  entities  are  subject  to  appropriately  segregated  approval  and independent ongoing oversight;
- d) identities are disabled or removed in a timely fashion if they are no longer required (e.g. if their associated entities are deleted or no longer used, or if the person linked to an identity has left the organization or changed the role);
- e) in a specific domain, a single identity is mapped to a single entity, [i.e. mapping of multiple identities to the same entity within the same context (duplicate identities) is avoided];
- f) records  of  all  significant  events  concerning  the  use  and  management  of  user  identities  and  of authentication information are kept.
The organization should have a supporting process in place to handle changes to information related to user identities. These processes can include re-verification of trusted documents related to a person.
When using identities provided or issued by third parties (e.g. social media credentials), the organization should ensure the third-party identities provide the required trust level and any associated risks are known and sufficiently treated. This can include controls related to the third parties (see ) as well as controls related to associated authentication information (see ).
## Other information
Providing  or  revoking  access  to  information  and  other  associated  assets  is  usually  a  multistep procedure:
- a) confirming the business requirements for an identity to be established;
- b) verifying the identity of an entity before allocating them a logical identity;
- c) establishing an identity;
- d) configuring and activating the identity. This also includes configuration and initial setup of related authentication services;
- e) providing or revoking specific access rights to the identity, based on appropriate authorization or entitlement decisions (see ).
##  Authentication information
| Control type   | Information security properties           | Cybersecurity concepts   | Operational capabilities          | Security domains   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| #Preventive    | #Confidentiality #Integrity #Availability | #Protect                 | #Identity_and_ac- cess_management | #Protection        |
## Control
Allocation  and  management  of  authentication  information  should  be  controlled  by  a  management process, including advising personnel on the appropriate handling of authentication information.
## Purpose
To ensure proper entity authentication and prevent failures of authentication processes.
## Guidance
## Allocation of authentication information
The allocation and management process should ensure that:
- a) personal  passwords  or  personal  identification  numbers  (PINs)  generated  automatically  during enrolment processes as temporary secret authentication information are non-guessable and unique for each person, and that users are required to change them after the first use;
- b) procedures are established to verify the identity of a user prior to providing new, replacement or temporary authentication information;
- c) authentication  information,  including  temporary  authentication  information,  is  transmitted to  users  in  a  secure  manner  (e.g.  over  an  authenticated  and  protected  channel)  and  the  use  of unprotected (clear text) electronic mail messages for this purpose is avoided;
- d) users acknowledge receipt of authentication information;
- e) default authentication information as predefined or provided by vendors is changed immediately following installation of systems or software;
- f) records of significant events concerning allocation and management of authentication information are kept and their confidentiality is granted, and that the record-keeping method is approved (e.g.
