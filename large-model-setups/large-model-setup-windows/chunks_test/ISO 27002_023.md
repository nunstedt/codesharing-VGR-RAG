by using an approved password vault tool).
## User responsibilities
Any person having access to or using authentication information should be advised to ensure that:
- a) secret  authentication  information  such  as  passwords  are  kept  confidential.  Personal  secret authentication information is not to be shared with anyone. Secret authentication information used in  the  context of identities linked to multiple users or linked to non-personal entities are solely shared with authorized persons;
- b) affected or compromised authentication information is changed immediately upon notification of or any other indication of a compromise;
- c) when  passwords  are  used  as  authentication  information,  strong  passwords  according  to  best practice recommendations are selected, for example:
- 1) passwords are not based on anything somebody else can easily guess or obtain using personrelated information (e.g. names, telephone numbers and dates of birth);
- 2) passwords are not based on dictionary words or combinations thereof;
- 3) use easy to remember passphrases and try to include alphanumerical and special characters;
- 4) passwords have a minimum length;
- d) the same passwords are not used across distinct services and systems;
- e) the obligation to follow these rules is also included in terms and conditions of employment (see ).
## Password management system
When passwords are used as authentication information, the password management system should:
- a) allow users to select and change their own passwords and include a confirmation procedure to address input errors;
- b) enforce strong passwords  according  to good  practice recommendations  [see  c) of "User responsibilities];
- c) force users to change their passwords at first login;
- d) enforce password changes as necessary, for example after a security incident, or upon termination or change of employment when a user has known passwords for identities that remain active (e.g. shared identities);
- e) prevent re-use of previous passwords;
- f) prevent the use of commonly-used passwords and compromised usernames, password combinations from hacked systems;
- g) not display passwords on the screen when being entered;
- h) store and transmit passwords in protected form.
Password  encryption  and  hashing  should  be  performed  according  to  approved  cryptographic techniques for passwords (see ).
## Other information
Passwords or passphrases are a commonly used type of authentication information and are a common means of verifying a user's identity. Other types of authentication information are cryptographic keys, data stored on hardware tokens (e.g. smart cards) that produce authentication codes and biometric data such as iris scans or fingerprints.
