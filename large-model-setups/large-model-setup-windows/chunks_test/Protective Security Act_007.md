Based on the specific protective security assessment and other circumstances, the operator must examine whether the transfer is appropriate from a protective security standpoint.
The specific protective security assessment and suitability examination must be documented.
If the suitability examination leads to the assessment that the transfer is inappropriate from a protective security standpoint, the transfer must not be undertaken. Act 2021:952.
## Section 15
If the suitability examination under Section 14 leads to the assessment that the transfer is not inappropriate from a protective security standpoint, the operator must consult with the supervisory authority.
The supervisory authority may decide to impose injunctions on the operator to take measures to fulfil its obligations under this Act and regulations issued in connection with it.
The obligation to engage in consultation and what is stated about the operator in the second paragraph also apply to anyone who intends to transfer shares in securitysensitive activities, except for shares in limited companies that are public under the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). Act 2021:952.
## Section 16
If the transferor does not consult with the supervisory authority despite being obliged to do so, the authority may initiate the consultation. Act 2021:952.
## Section 17
If a decision to impose injunctions under section 15 is not complied with or if the transfer is inappropriate from a protective security standpoint even if additional measures are taken, the supervisory authority may decide that the transfer must not be undertaken (prohibition). Act 2021:952.
## Section 18
A transfer in contravention of a prohibition under Section 17 is invalid.
If a transfer has been undertaken without consultation under Section 15 or 16 and the conditions for a prohibition under Section 17 are fulfilled, the supervisory authority may impose such a prohibition after the transfer has been made. The transfer is then invalid. Act 2021:952.
## Section 19
If a transfer is invalid under Section 18, the supervisory authority may impose any injunctions against the transferor and the transferee that are necessary in order to prevent damage to Sweden's security. A decision to impose injunctions may be combined with a financial penalty. Act 2021:952.
## Section 20
An operator that intends to transfer all or any part of security-sensitive activities must notify the transferee that this Act applies to the activities. This notification must contain information about the obligations that apply to an operator under Chapter 2, Section 1.
Act 2021:952.
## Chapter 5 International protective security cooperation and security certificates
## Security certificates
## Section 1
A security certificate may be issued for persons who are habitually resident in Sweden and contractors domiciled in Sweden when another state or an international organisation has applied for such a certificate, if:
- 1. there is a need for such a certificate in international cooperation concerning security-sensitive activities under this Act; or
- 2. in addition to what follows from point 1, the certificate may facilitate the participation of a person or contractor in activities that another state or an international organisation deems to require protective security.
A certificate under the first paragraph may only be issued if the participation concerns activities in or for a state or international organisation that is covered by an international security protection commitment. If there are special grounds to do so, the Government may decide that a certificate may be issued despite the absence of an international security protection commitment. Act 2021:952.
## Section 2
If it is necessary in order for a security certificate to be issued, security vetting involving record checks under Chapter 3, Section 13 may be undertaken. As part of such security vetting, a special personal investigation under Chapter 3, Section 17 may also be undertaken. Act 2021:952.
## Section 3

## Record checks upon application by another state or an international organisation
## Section 4
Record checks under Chapter 3, Section 13 may be undertaken when another state or an international organisation has applied for such material, if:
- 1. the person whom the application concerns is or has been habitually resident in Sweden; and
- 2. by virtue of their employment or in some other way, the person is to participate in activities where participation is subject to requirements corresponding to provisions in this Act concerning record checks as part of security vetting.
As part of record checks under the first paragraph, a special personal investigation under Chapter 3, Section 17 may also be undertaken. Act 2021:952.
## Section 5
The provisions concerning record checks, special personal investigations and consent in Chapter 3, Section 13, Section 14, second to fourth paragraphs, and Sections 17-21 apply to matters under Section 4. Act 2021:952.
## Who orders record checks and issues certificates
## Section 6
The Government may, pursuant to Chapter 8, Article 7 of the Instrument of Government, issue regulations concerning which authority decides on record checks under Sections 2 and 4, issues certificates under Section 1 and provides material under Section 4.
