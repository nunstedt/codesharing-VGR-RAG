- 7. Devices shall be designed, manufactured and packaged in such a way that their characteristics and performance during  their  intended  use  are  not  adversely  affected  during  transport  and  storage,  for  example,  through fluctuations  of  temperature  and  humidity,  taking  account  of  the  instructions  and  information  provided  by  the manufacturer.
- 8. All  known  and  foreseeable  risks,  and  any  undesirable  side-effects,  shall  be  minimised  and  be  acceptable  when weighed against  the  evaluated benefits  to  the  patient  and/or  user  arising  from  the  achieved  performance  of  the device during normal conditions of use.
- 9. For  the  devices  referred  to  in  Annex  XVI,  the  general  safety  requirements  set  out  in  Sections  1  and  8  shall  be understood to  mean  that  the  device,  when  used  under  the  conditions  and  for  the  purposes  intended,  does  not present  a  risk  at  all  or  presents  a  risk  that  is  no  more  than  the  maximum  acceptable  risk  related  to  the product's use which is consistent with a high level of protection for  the safety and health of persons.
## CHAPTER II
## REQUIREMENTS REGARDING DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
- 10. Chemical, physical and biological properties
- . Devices shall be designed and manufactured in such a way  as to ensure that the characteristics and performance requirements referred to in Chapter I are fulfilled. Particular attention shall be paid to:
- (a)   the choice of materials and substances used, particularly as regards toxicity and, where relevant, flammability;
- (b)   the  compatibility  between  the  materials  and  substances  used  and  biological  tissues,  cells  and  body  fluids, taking  account  of the  intended  purpose  of the device and, where  relevant, absorption,  distribution, metabolism and excretion;
- (c)   the  compatibility between the different parts of a device which consists of more than one implantable part;
- (d)   the  impact of processes on material properties;
- (e)   where appropriate, the results of biophysical  or modelling  research  the  validity  of  which  has  been demonstrated beforehand;
- (f)   the  mechanical  properties  of  the  materials  used,  reflecting,  where  appropriate,  matters  such  as  strength, ductility, fracture resistance, wear resistance and fatigue resistance;
- (g)   surface properties; and
- (h)   the  confirmation that the device meets any defined chemical and/or physical specifications.
- . Devices  shall  be  designed,  manufactured  and  packaged  in  such  a  way  as  to  minimise  the  risk  posed  by contaminants  and  residues  to  patients,  taking  account  of  the  intended  purpose  of  the  device,  and  to  the persons  involved  in  the  transport,  storage  and  use  of  the  devices.  Particular  attention  shall  be  paid  to  tissues exposed to those contaminants and residues and to the duration and frequency of exposure.
