Those  rules  should  be  clear  and  robust  in  protecting  fundamental  rights, supportive  of  new  innovative  solutions,  enabling  a  European  ecosystem  of  public  and  private  actors  creating  AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including  startups,  this  Regulation  supports  the  objective  of  promoting  the  European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI as stated by the European Council ( 5 ), and it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the European Parliament ( 6 ).
( 5 ) European Council, Special  meeting of  the  European  Council  (1  and  2  October  2020)  -  Conclusions,  EUCO  13/20,  2020,  p.  6.

- (9) Harmonised  rules  applicable  to  the  placing  on  the  market,  the  putting  into  service  and  the  use  of  high-risk  AI systems should be laid down consistently with Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 7 ),  Decision  No  768/2008/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council ( 8 )  and  Regulation  (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 9 )  (New  Legislative  Framework). The harmonised rules laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line with the New Legislative Framework, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, in particular on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment,  and  protection  of  workers,  and  product  safety,  to  which  this  Regulation  is  complementary.  As a consequence, all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and other persons on whom AI  systems  may  have  a  negative  impact,  including  as  regards  the  compensation  of  possible  damages  pursuant  to Council Directive 85/374/EEC ( 10 ) remain unaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and protection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social policy and national  labour  law,  in  compliance  with  Union  law,  concerning  employment  and  working  conditions,  including health  and  safety  at  work  and  the  relationship  between  employers  and  workers.  This  Regulation  should  also  not affect the exercise of fundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at Union level, including the right or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial relations systems in Member States as well as  the  right  to  negotiate,  to  conclude  and  enforce  collective  agreements  or  to  take  collective  action  in  accordance with  national  law.  This  Regulation  should  not  affect  the  provisions  aiming  to  improve  working  conditions  in platform  work  laid  down  in  a  Directive  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  on  improving  working conditions in platform work. Moreover, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such existing rights and  remedies  by  establishing  specific  requirements  and  obligations,  including  in  respect  of  the  transparency, technical  documentation  and  record-keeping  of  AI  systems.  Furthermore,  the  obligations  placed  on  various operators  involved in  the  AI  value  chain  under  this  Regulation  should  apply  without  prejudice  to  national  law,  in compliance with Union law, having the effect of  limiting the use of certain AI systems where such law falls outside the  scope  of  this  Regulation  or  pursues  legitimate  public  interest  objectives  other  than  those  pursued  by  this Regulation. For example, national labour law and law on the protection of minors, namely persons below the age of 18, taking into account the UNCRC General Comment No 25 (2021) on children's rights in relation to the digital environment,  insofar  as  they  are  not  specific  to  AI  systems  and  pursue  other  legitimate  public  interest  objectives, should not  be  affected  by  this  Regulation.
- (10) The  fundamental  right  to  the  protection  of  personal  data  is  safeguarded  in  particular  by  Regulations  (EU) 2016/679 ( 11 ) and (EU) 2018/1725 ( 12 ) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council ( 13 ).  Directive  2002/58/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the Council ( 14 )  additionally  protects  private  life  and  the  confidentiality  of  communications,  including  by  way  of providing  conditions  for  any  storing  of  personal  and  non-personal  data  in,  and  access  from,  terminal  equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for sustainable and responsible data processing, including where data sets include a mix of personal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application of existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and powers of the independent supervisory authorities  competent  to  monitor  compliance  with  those  instruments.  It  also  does  not  affect  the  obligations  of providers  and  deployers  of  AI  systems  in  their  role  as  data  controllers  or  processors  stemming  from  Union  or national  law on  the  protection  of  personal  data  in  so  far  as  the  design,  the  development  or  the  use  of  AI  systems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that data subjects continue to enjoy all the
