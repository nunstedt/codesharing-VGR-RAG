## All providers of GPAI models must (Art. 53):
- ∞ Draw  up technical  documentation ,  including  training  and  testing  process  and  evaluation results.
- ∞ Draw up information and documentation to supply to downstream providers that  intend to integrate  the  GPAI  model  into  their  own  AI  system  in  order  that  the  latter  understands capabilities and limitations and is enabled to comply.
- ∞ Establish a policy to respect the Copyright Directive.
- ∞ Publish a sufficiently detailed summary about the content used for training the GPAI model.
Free and open licence GPAI models -  whose parameters, including weights, model architecture and model  usage  are  publicly  available,  allowing  for  access,  usage,  modification  and  distribution  of  the model - only have to comply with the latter two obligations above, unless the free and open licence GPAI model is systemic.
GPAI models are considered systemic when the cumulative amount of compute used for its training is greater than 10^25 floating point operations per second (FLOPS) (Art. 51). Providers must notify the Commission if their model meets this criterion within 2 weeks (Art. 52). The provider may present arguments  that,  despite  meeting  the  criteria,  their  model  does  not  present  systemic  risks.  The Commission may decide on its own, or via a qualified alert from the scientific panel of independent experts, that a model has high impact capabilities, rendering it systemic.
In addition to the four obligations above, providers of GPAI models with systemic risk must also (Art. 55):
- ∞ Perform model  evaluations ,  including  conducting  and  documenting adversarial  testing to identify and mitigate systemic risk.
- ∞ Assess and mitigate possible systemic risks , including their sources.
- ∞ Track,  document  and  report  serious  incidents and  possible  corrective  measures  to  the  AI Office and relevant national competent authorities without undue delay.
- ∞ Ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection .
All GPAI model providers may demonstrate compliance with their obligations if they voluntarily adhere to codes of practice until European harmonised standards are published, compliance with which will
lead to a presumption of conformity (Art. 56). Providers that don't adhere to codes of practice must demonstrate alternative adequate means of compliance for Commission approval.
## Codes of practice (Art. 56)
- ∞ Will account for international approaches.
- ∞ Will  cover  but  not  necessarily  limited  to  the  above  obligations,  particularly  the  relevant information  to  include  in  technical  documentation  for  authorities  and  downstream  providers, identification of the type and nature of systemic risks and their sources, and the modalities of risk  management accounting for specific challenges in addressing risks due to the way they may emerge and materialise throughout the value chain.
- ∞ AI Office may  invite GPAI  model  providers,  relevant national competent  authorities  to participate  in  drawing  up  the  codes,  while  civil  society,  industry,  academia,  downstream providers and independent experts may support the process.
## Governance (Chapter VI)
- ∞ The  AI  Office  will  be  established,  sitting  within  the  Commission,  to  monitor  the  effective implementation and compliance of GPAI model providers (Art. 64).
- ∞ Downstream providers can lodge a complaint regarding the upstream providers infringement to the AI Office (Art. 89).
- ∞ The AI Office may conduct evaluations of the GPAI model to (Art. 92):
- o assess  compliance  where  the  information  gathered  under  its  powers  to  request information is insufficient.
- o Investigate  systemic  risks,  particularly  following  a  qualified  report  from  the  scientific panel of independent experts (Art. 90).
## Timelines
After entry into force, the AI Act will apply by the following deadlines:
- ∞ 6 months for prohibited AI systems.
- ∞ 12 months for GPAI.
- ∞ 24 months for high risk AI systems under Annex III.
- ∞ 36 months for high risk AI systems under Annex I.
Codes of practice must be ready 9 months after entry into force.
