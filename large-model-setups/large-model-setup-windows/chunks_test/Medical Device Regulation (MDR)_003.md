- ( 5 ) Directive 2014/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility (OJ L 96, . p. 79).
- ( 6 ) Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom of 5 December 2013 laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation, and repealing Directives 89/618/Euratom, 90/641/Euratom, 96/29/Euratom, 97/43/Euratom and 2003/122/Euratom (OJ L 13, , p. 1). - (19) It  is  necessary  to  clarify  that  software  in  its  own  right,  when  specifically  intended  by the  manufacturer  to be used for  one  or  more  of  the  medical  purposes  set  out  in  the  definition  of  a  medical  device,  qualifies  as  a  medical device,  while  software  for  general  purposes,  even  when  used  in  a  healthcare  setting,  or  software  intended  for life-style  and  well-being  purposes  is  not  a  medical  device.  The  qualification  of  software,  either  as  a  device  or  an accessory,  is  independent  of  the  software's  location  or  the  type  of  interconnection  between  the  software  and a device.
- (20) The  definitions  in  this  Regulation,  regarding  devices  themselves,  the  making  available  of  devices,  economic operators,  users  and  specific  processes,  the  conformity  assessment,  clinical  investigations  and  clinical  evaluations, post-market  surveillance,  vigilance  and  market  surveillance,  standards  and  other  technical  specifications,  should be  aligned  with  well-established  practice  in  the  field  at  Union  and  international  level  in  order  to  enhance  legal certainty.
- (21) It  should  be  made  clear  that  it  is  essential  that  devices  offered  to  persons  in  the  Union  by  means  of  information society  services  within  the  meaning  of  Directive  (EU)  2015/1535  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the Council  ( 1 )  and  devices  used  in  the  context of a  commercial activity  to provide a diagnostic  or  therapeutic  service to  persons  within  the  Union  comply  with  the  requirements  of  this  Regulation,  where  the  product  in  question  is placed on the market or the service is provided in the Union.
- (22) To  recognise  the  important  role  of  standardisation  in  the  field  of  medical  devices,  compliance  with  harmonised standards as defined  in  Regulation  (EU)  No  1025/2012 of  the European Parliament and of  the  Council  ( 2 )  should be  a  means  for  manufacturers  to  demonstrate  conformity  with  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements and  other legal  requirements, such  as those relating to quality and  risk  management,  laid  down  in  this Regulation.
- (23) Directive  98/79/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  ( 3 )  allows  the  Commission  to  adopt  common technical specifications for specific categories of in  vitro diagnostic medical devices. In areas where no harmonised standards  exist  or  where  they  are  insufficient,  the  Commission  should  be  empowered  to  lay  down  common specifications  which  provide  a  means  of  complying  with  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements,  and the  requirements  for  clinical  investigations  and  clinical  evaluation  and/or  post-market  clinical  follow-up,  laid down in this Regulation.
- (24) Common specifications  ('CS')  should  be  developed  after  consulting  the  relevant  stakeholders  and  taking  account of European and international standards.
- (25) The rules applicable to devices should be aligned, where appropriate, with the New Legislative Framework for  the Marketing  of  Products,  which  consists  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  765/2008  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the Council  ( 4 )  and Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 5 ).
- (26) The  rules  on  Union  market  surveillance  and  control  of  products  entering  the  Union  market  laid  down  in Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 apply to devices covered by this Regulation which does not prevent Member States from choosing the competent authorities to carry out those tasks.
- (27) It  is  appropriate to set out clearly the general obligations of  the different economic operators, including importers and  distributors,  building  on  the  New  Legislative  Framework  for  the  Marketing  of  Products,  without  prejudice  to the  specific  obligations  laid  down  in  the  various  parts  of  this  Regulation,  to  enhance  understanding  of  the requirements laid down in this Regulation and thus to improve regulatory compliance by the relevant operators.
- ( 1 ) Directive  (EU)  2015/1535  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  9  September  2015  laying  down  a  procedure  for  the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ L 241, , p. 1).
( 2 ) Regulation  (EU)  No  1025/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  25  October  2012  on  European  standardisation, amending  Council  Directives  89/686/EEC  and  93/15/EEC  and  Directives  94/9/EC,  94/25/EC,  95/16/EC,  97/23/EC,  98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC,  2007/23/EC,  2009/23/EC  and  2009/105/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  and  repealing  Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 316, , p. 12).
