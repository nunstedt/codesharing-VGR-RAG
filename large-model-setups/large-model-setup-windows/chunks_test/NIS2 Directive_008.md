- (142) Since  the  objective  of  this  Directive,  namely  to  achieve  a  high  common  level  of  cybersecurity  across  the  Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article  5  of  the  Treaty on  European  Union.  In  accordance  with  the  principle  of  proportionality  as  set  out  in  that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
- (143) This Directive respects the fundamental rights, and observes the principles, recognised by the Charter, in particular the right to respect for private life and communications, the protection of personal data, the freedom to conduct a business, the right to property, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence and the rights of the defence. The right to an effective remedy extends to the recipients of services provided by essential and important entities. This Directive should be implemented in accordance with those rights and principles.
