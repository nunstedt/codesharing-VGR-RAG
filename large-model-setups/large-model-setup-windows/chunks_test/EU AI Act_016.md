Similarly, in the health sector  where the  stakes  for  life  and  health  are  particularly  high,  increasingly  sophisticated  diagnostics  systems  and  systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate.
- (48) The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights protected by the Charter is of particular  relevance  when  classifying  an  AI  system  as  high  risk.  Those  rights  include  the  right  to  human  dignity, respect for  private and family life, protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and of association, the right to non-discrimination, the right to education, consumer protection, workers' rights,  the  rights  of  persons  with  disabilities,  gender  equality,  intellectual  property  rights,  the  right  to  an  effective remedy  and  to  a  fair  trial,  the  right  of  defence  and  the  presumption  of  innocence,  and  the  right  to  good administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight the fact that children have specific rights as enshrined  in  Article  24  of  the  Charter  and  in  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  further developed  in  the  UNCRC  General  Comment  No  25  as  regards  the  digital  environment,  both  of  which  require consideration  of  the  children's  vulnerabilities  and  provision  of  such  protection  and  care  as  necessary  for  their well-being.  The  fundamental  right  to  a  high  level  of  environmental  protection  enshrined  in  the  Charter  and implemented in Union policies should also be considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can  cause,  including  in  relation  to  the  health  and  safety of  persons.
