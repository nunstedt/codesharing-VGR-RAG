The  application  shall  be  submitted  by  means  of  the  electronic  system  referred  to  in  Article  73,  which  shall  generate a  Union-wide  unique  single  identification  number  for  the  clinical  investigation,  which  shall  be  used  for  all  relevant communication in relation to that clinical investigation.

Within one week of any change occurring in relation to the documentation referred to in Chapter II of Annex XV, the sponsor shall update the relevant data in the electronic system referred to in Article 73 and make that change to the documentation  clearly  identifiable.  The  Member  State  concerned  shall  be  notified  of  the  update  by  means  of  that electronic system.

Where  the  sponsor  has  not  provided  comments  nor  completed  the  application  within  the  time  limit  referred  to  in  the first  subparagraph, the application shall be deemed to have lapsed. Where the sponsor considers the application does fall under  the  scope  of  this  Regulation  and/or  is  complete  but  the  Member  State  concerned  does  not,  the  application  shall be  considered  to  have  been  rejected.  The  Member  State  concerned  shall  provide  for  an  appeal  procedure  in  respect  of such refusal.
The  Member  State  concerned  shall  notify  the  sponsor  within  five  days  of  receipt  of  the  comments  or  of  the  requested additional information, whether  the clinical investigation is considered as falling within the scope of  this Regulation and the application is complete.
- 4. The  Member  State  concerned  may  also  extend  the  period  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  and  3  each  by  a  further five  days.

- (b)   in  the  case  of  investigational  devices,  other  than  those  referred  to  in  point  (a),  as  soon  as  the  Member  State concerned  has  notified  the  sponsor  of  its  authorisation,  and  provided  that  a  negative  opinion  which  is  valid  for  the entire Member State, under national law, has not been issued by an ethics committee in the Member State concerned in  respect  of  the  clinical  investigation.
