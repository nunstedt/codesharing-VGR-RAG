## Control
Relevant information security requirements should be established and agreed with each supplier based on the type of supplier relationship.
## Purpose
To maintain an agreed level of information security in supplier relationships.
## Guidance
Supplier agreements should be established and documented to ensure that there is clear understanding between  the  organization  and  the  supplier  regarding  both  parties'  obligations  to  fulfil  relevant information security requirements.
The following terms can be considered for inclusion in the agreements in order to satisfy the identified information security requirements:
- a) description of the information to be provided or accessed and methods of providing or accessing the information;
- b) classification  of  information  according  to  the  organization's  classification  scheme  (see , ,  );
- c) mapping between the organization's own classification scheme and the classification scheme of the supplier;
- d) legal,  statutory,  regulatory  and  contractual  requirements,  including  data  protection,  handling of  personally  identifiable  information  (PII),  intellectual  property  rights  and  copyright  and  a description of how it will be ensured that they are met;
- e) obligation  of  each  contractual  party  to  implement  an  agreed  set  of  controls,  including  access control, performance review, monitoring, reporting and auditing, and the supplier's obligations to comply with the organization's information security requirements;
- f) rules  of  acceptable  use  of  information  and  other  associated  assets,  including  unacceptable  use if necessary;
- g) procedures  or  conditions  for  authorization  and  removal  of  the  authorization  for  the  use  of  the organization's  information  and  other  associated  assets  by  supplier  personnel  (e.g.  through  an explicit  list  of  supplier  personnel  authorized  to  use  the  organization's  information  and  other associated assets);
- h) information  security  requirements  regarding  the  supplier's  ICT  infrastructure;  in  particular, minimum information security requirements for each type of information and type of access to serve as the basis for individual supplier agreements based on the organization's business needs and risk criteria;
- i) indemnities and remediation for failure of contractor to meet requirements;
- j) incident  management  requirements  and  procedures  (especially  notification  and  collaboration during incident remediation);
- k) training and awareness requirements for specific procedures and information security requirements (e.g. for incident response, authorization procedures);
- l) relevant provisions for sub-contracting, including the controls that need to be implemented, such as agreement on the use of sub-suppliers (e.g. requiring to have them under the same obligations of the supplier, requiring to have a list of sub-suppliers and notification before any change);
- m)  relevant contacts, including a contact person for information security issues;
- n) any  screening  requirements,  where  legally  permissible,  for  the  supplier's  personnel,  including responsibilities for conducting the screening and notification procedures if screening has not been completed or if the results give cause for doubt or concern;
- o) the  evidence  and  assurance  mechanisms  of  third-party  attestations  for  relevant  information security requirements related to the supplier processes and an independent report on effectiveness of controls;
- p) right to audit the supplier processes and controls related to the agreement;
- q) supplier's obligation to periodically deliver a report on the effectiveness of controls and agreement on timely correction of relevant issues raised in the report;
- r) defect resolution and conflict resolution processes;
- s) providing  backup  aligned  with  the  organization's  needs  (in  terms  of  frequency  and  type  and storage location);
- t) ensuring the availability of an alternate facility (i.e. disaster recovery site) not subject to the same threats as the primary facility and considerations for fall back controls (alternate controls) in the event primary controls fail;
- u) having a change management process that ensures advance notification to the organization and the possibility for the organization of not accepting changes;
- v) physical security controls commensurate with the information classification;
- w) information  transfer  controls  to  protect  the  information  during  physical  transfer  or  logical transmission;
- x) termination clauses upon conclusion of the agreement including records management, return of assets, secure disposal of information and other associated assets, and any ongoing confidentiality obligations;
- y) provision of a method of securely destroying the organization's information stored by the supplier as soon as it is no longer required;
- z) ensuring, at the end of the contract, handover support to another supplier or to the organization itself.
The organization should establish and maintain a register of agreements with external parties (e.g. contracts, memorandum of understanding, information-sharing agreements) to keep track of where their  information is going. The organization should also regularly review, validate and update their agreements with external parties to ensure they are still required and fit for purpose with relevant information security clauses.
## Other information
The  agreements  can  vary  considerably  for  different  organizations  and  among  the  different  types of  suppliers.  Therefore,  care  should  be  taken  to  include  all  relevant  requirements  for  addressing information security risks.

##  Managing information security in the ICT supply chain
| Control type   | Information security properties           | Cybersecurity concepts   | Operational capabilities           | Security domains                         |

| #Preventive    | #Confidentiality #Integrity #Availability | #Identify                | #Supplier_relation- ships_security | #Governance_and_ Ecosystem #Protec- tion |
## Control
Processes  and  procedures  should  be  defined  and  implemented  to  manage  the  information  security risks associated with the ICT products and services supply chain.
## Purpose
To maintain an agreed level of information security in supplier relationships.
## Guidance
The following topics should be considered to address information security within ICT supply chain security in addition to the general information security requirements for supplier relationships:
- a) defining information security requirements to apply to ICT product or service acquisition;
- b) requiring that ICT services suppliers propagate the organization's security requirements throughout  the  supply  chain  if  they  sub-contract  for  parts  of  the  ICT  service  provided  to  the organization;
- c) requiring  that  ICT  products  suppliers  propagate  appropriate  security  practices  throughout  the supply chain if these products include components purchased or acquired from other suppliers or other entities (e.g. sub-contracted software developers and hardware component providers);
- d) requesting that ICT products suppliers provide information describing the software components used in products;
- e) requesting that ICT products suppliers provide information describing the implemented security functions of their product and the configuration required for its secure operation;
- f) implementing  a  monitoring  process  and  acceptable  methods  for  validating  that  delivered  ICT products and services comply with stated security requirements. Examples of such supplier review methods can include penetration testing and proof or validation of third-party attestations for the supplier's information security operations;
- g) implementing  a  process  for  identifying  and  documenting  product  or  service  components  that are  critical  for  maintaining  functionality  and  therefore  require  increased  attention,  scrutiny and further follow up required when built outside of the organization especially if the supplier outsources aspects of product or service components to other suppliers;
- h) obtaining  assurance  that  critical  components  and  their  origin  can  be  traced  throughout  the supply chain;
- i) obtaining  assurance  that  the  delivered  ICT  products  are  functioning  as  expected  without  any unexpected or unwanted features;
- j) implementing processes to ensure that components from suppliers are genuine and unaltered from their specification. Example measures include anti-tamper labels, cryptographic hash verifications or  digital  signatures.  Monitoring  for  out  of  specification  performance  can  be  an  indicator  of tampering or counterfeits. Prevention and detection of tampering should be implemented during multiple stages in the system development life cycle, including design, development, integration, operations and maintenance;
- k) obtaining assurance that ICT products achieve required security levels, for example, through formal certification or an evaluation scheme such as the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement;
- l) defining rules for sharing of information regarding the supply chain and any potential issues and compromises among the organization and suppliers;
- m)  implementing  specific  processes  for  managing  ICT  component  life  cycle  and  availability  and associated security risks. This includes managing the risks of components no longer being available due to suppliers no longer being in business or suppliers no longer providing these components due to technology advancements. Identification of an alternative supplier and the process to transfer software and competence to the alternative supplier should be considered.
## Other information
The  specific  ICT  supply  chain  risk  management  practices  are  built  on  top  of  general  information security, quality, project management and system engineering practices but do not replace them.
Organizations are advised to work with suppliers to understand the ICT supply chain and any matters that  have  an  important  effect  on  the  products  and  services  being  provided.  The  organization  can influence ICT supply chain information security practices by making clear in agreements with their suppliers the matters that should be addressed by other suppliers in the ICT supply chain.
ICT should be acquired from reputable sources. The reliability of software and hardware is a matter of quality control. While it is generally not possible for an organization to inspect the quality control systems of its vendors, it can make reliable judgments based on the reputation of the vendor.
ICT supply chain as addressed here includes cloud services.
Examples of ICT supply chains are:
- a) cloud services provisioning, where the cloud service provider relies on the software developers, telecommunication service providers, hardware providers;
- b) IoT,  where  the  service  involves  the  device  manufacturers,  the  cloud  service  providers  (e.g. the  IoT  platform  operators),  the  developers  for  mobile  and  web  applications,  the  vendor  of software libraries;
- c) hosting services, where the provider relies on external service desks including first, second and third support levels.
