## Article  58
## Detailed arrangements for, and functioning of, AI regulatory sandboxes
- 1. In  order  to  avoid  fragmentation  across  the  Union,  the  Commission  shall  adopt  implementing  acts  specifying  the detailed arrangements for the establishment, development, implementation, operation and supervision of the AI regulatory sandboxes. The implementing acts shall include  common principles  on the following issues:
- (a) eligibility  and  selection  criteria  for  participation  in  the  AI  regulatory  sandbox;
- (b) procedures for  the application, participation, monitoring,  exiting from and termination of  the AI regulatory sandbox, including  the  sandbox  plan  and  the  exit  report;
- (c) the  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to  the  participants.
Those implementing acts shall  be  adopted  in  accordance  with  the  examination procedure  referred  to in  Article  98(2).
- 2. The implementing acts referred  to in paragraph 1  shall  ensure:
- (a) that  AI  regulatory  sandboxes  are  open  to  any  applying  provider  or  prospective  provider  of  an  AI  system  who  fulfils eligibility  and  selection  criteria,  which  shall  be  transparent  and  fair,  and  that  national  competent  authorities  inform applicants  of  their  decision  within  three  months  of  the  application;
- (b) that AI regulatory sandboxes allow broad and equal access and keep up with demand for participation; providers and prospective  providers  may  also  submit  applications  in  partnerships  with  deployers  and  other  relevant  third  parties;
- (c) that  the  detailed  arrangements  for,  and  conditions  concerning  AI  regulatory  sandboxes  support,  to  the  best  extent possible,  flexibility  for  national  competent  authorities  to  establish  and  operate  their  AI  regulatory  sandboxes;
- (d) that  access  to  the  AI  regulatory  sandboxes  is  free  of  charge  for  SMEs,  including  start-ups,  without  prejudice  to exceptional costs  that  national  competent  authorities  may  recover  in  a  fair  and  proportionate  manner;
- (e) that  they  facilitate  providers  and  prospective  providers,  by  means  of  the  learning  outcomes  of  the  AI  regulatory sandboxes, in complying with conformity assessment obligations under  this Regulation and the voluntary application of  the  codes  of  conduct  referred  to  in  Article  95;
- (f) that AI regulatory sandboxes facilitate the involvement of other relevant actors within the AI ecosystem, such as notified bodies  and  standardisation  organisations,  SMEs,  including  start-ups,  enterprises,  innovators,  testing  and  experimentation  facilities,  research  and  experimentation  labs  and  European  Digital  Innovation  Hubs,  centres  of  excellence, individual  researchers,  in  order  to  allow  and  facilitate  cooperation  with  the  public  and  private  sectors;
- (g) that  procedures,  processes  and  administrative  requirements  for application,  selection,  participation  and  exiting  the  AI regulatory  sandbox  are  simple,  easily  intelligible,  and  clearly  communicated  in  order  to  facilitate  the  participation  of SMEs, including start-ups, with limited legal and administrative capacities and are streamlined across the Union, in order to  avoid  fragmentation  and  that  participation  in  an  AI  regulatory  sandbox  established  by  a  Member  State,  or  by  the European Data Protection Supervisor is mutually and uniformly recognised and carries the same legal effects across the Union;
- (h) that participation in the AI regulatory sandbox is limited to a period that is appropriate to the complexity and scale of the  project  and  that  may  be  extended  by  the  national  competent  authority;
- (i) that AI regulatory sandboxes facilitate the development of tools and infrastructure for testing, benchmarking, assessing and explaining dimensions  of AI systems relevant for regulatory learning, such as accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity,  as  well  as  measures  to  mitigate  risks  to  fundamental  rights  and  society  at  large.
