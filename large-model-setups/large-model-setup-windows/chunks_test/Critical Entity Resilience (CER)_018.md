## Article 6
## Identification of critical entities
- 1. By 17 July 2026, each Member State shall identify the critical entities for  the sectors and subsectors set out in the Annex.
- 2. When a Member State identifies critical entities pursuant to paragraph 1, it shall take into account the outcomes of its Member State risk assessment and its strategy and shall apply all of the following criteria:
- (a) the entity provides one or more essential services;
- (b) the entity operates, and its critical infrastructure is located, on the territory of that Member State; and
- (c) an incident would have significant disruptive effects, as determined in accordance with Article 7(1), on the provision by the entity of one or more essential services or on the provision of other essential services in the sectors set out in the Annex that depend on that or those essential services.
- 3. Each Member State shall establish a list of the critical entities identified pursuant to paragraph 2 and ensure that those critical entities are notified that they have been identified as critical entities within one month of that identification. Member States  shall  inform  those  critical  entities  of  their  obligations  under  Chapters  III  and  IV  and  the  date  from  which  those obligations apply to them, without prejudice to Article 8. Member States shall inform critical entities in the sectors set out in  points  3,  4  and  8  of  the  table  in  the  Annex  that  they  have  no  obligations  under  Chapters  III  and  IV,  unless  national measures provide otherwise.
For the critical entities concerned, Chapter III shall apply from 10 months after the date of the notification referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
- 4. Member States  shall  ensure  that  their  competent  authorities  under  this  Directive  notify  the  competent  authorities under Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of  the identity of  the critical entities  that  they  have  identified  under  this  Article  within one month of that identification. That notification shall specify, where applicable, that the critical entities concerned are entities in the sectors set out in points 3, 4 and 8 of the table in the Annex to this Directive and have no obligations under Chapters III and IV thereof. - 5. Member  States  shall,  where  necessary  and  in  any  event  at  least  every  four  years,  review  and,  where  appropriate, update the  list  of  identified  critical  entities  referred  to  in  paragraph  3.  Where  those  updates  lead  to  the  identification  of additional critical entities,  paragraphs 3 and 4 shall apply to those additional critical entities. In addition, Member States shall ensure that entities that are no longer identified as critical entities following any such update are notified in due time of that fact and the fact that they are no longer subject to the obligations under Chapter III from the date of receipt of that notification.
- 6. The  Commission  shall,  in  cooperation  with  the  Member  States,  develop  recommendations  and  non-binding guidelines to support Member States in identifying critical entities.
## Article 7
## Significant disruptive effect
- 1. When determining the significance of a disruptive effect as referred to in Article 6(2), point (c), Member States shall take into account the following criteria:
- (a) the number of users relying on the essential service provided by the entity concerned;
- (b) the extent to which other sectors and subsectors as set out in the Annex depend on the essential service in question;
- (c) the  impact  that  incidents  could  have,  in  terms  of  degree  and  duration,  on  economic  and  societal  activities,  the environment, public safety and security, or the health of the population;
- (d) the entity's market share in the market for the essential service or essential services concerned;
- (e) the geographic area that could be affected by an incident, including any cross-border impact, taking into account the vulnerability  associated  with  the  degree  of  isolation  of  certain  types  of  geographic  areas,  such  as  insular  regions, remote regions or mountainous areas;
- (f) the importance of the entity in maintaining a sufficient level of the essential service, taking into account the availability of alternative means for the provision of that essential service.
- 2. After  the  identification  of  the  critical  entities  under  Article  6(1),  each  Member  State  shall  submit  the  following information to the Commission without undue delay:
- (a) a list of essential services in that Member State where there are any additional essential services as compared to the list of essential services referred to in Article 5(1);
- (b) the  number  of  critical  entities  identified  for  each  sector  and  subsector  set  out  in  the  Annex  and  for  each  essential service;
- (c) any thresholds applied to specify one or more of the criteria in paragraph 1.
Thresholds as referred to in the first subparagraph, point (c), may be presented as such or in aggregated form.
Member States shall subsequently submit information referred to in the first subparagraph whenever necessary and at least every four years.
- 3. The Commission shall, after consulting  the  Critical  Entities  Resilience  Group  referred  to  in  Article  19,  adopt  nonbinding guidelines to facilitate the application of the criteria referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, taking into account the information referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.

- 4. Each Member State shall  ensure  that  its  competent  authority  and  single  point  of  contact  have  the  powers  and  the adequate financial, human and technical resources to carry out, in an effective and efficient manner, the tasks assigned to them.
- 5. Each Member State shall ensure that its competent authority, whenever appropriate, and in accordance with Union and  national  law,  consults  and  cooperates  with  other  relevant  national  authorities,  including  those  in  charge  of  civil protection, law enforcement and the protection of personal data, and with critical entities and relevant interested parties.
- 6. Each  Member  State  shall  ensure  that  its  competent  authority  under  this  Directive  cooperates  and  exchanges information with competent authorities under Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on cybersecurity risks, cyber  threats and cyber incidents and non-cyber risks, threats and incidents affecting critical entities, including with regard to relevant measures its competent authority and competent authorities under Directive (EU) 2022/2555 have taken. - 7. Within three months of the designation or establishment of the competent authority and the single point of contact, each Member State shall notify the Commission of their identity and their  tasks and responsibilities under  this Directive, their contact details and any subsequent change thereto. Member States shall inform the Commission where they decide to designate  an  authority  other  than  the  competent  authorities  referred  to  in  paragraph  1,  second  subparagraph,  as  the competent authorities in respect of the critical entities in the sectors set out in points 3, 4 and 8 of the table in the Annex. Each Member State shall make public the identity of its competent authority and single point of contact.
- 8. The Commission shall make a list of the single points of contact publicly available.
