Rationale and objectives
(240) Emotion  recognition  technology  is  quickly  evolving  and  comprehends  different technologies  and  processing  operations  to  detect,  collect,  analyse,  categorise,  react, interact and learn emotions from persons. Such technology is also referred to as 'affect technology'. Emotion recognition can be used in multiple areas and domains for a wide range  of  applications 146 such  as  for  analysing  customer  behaviour 147 and  targeted advertising  and  neuromarketing 148 ;  in  the  entertainment  industry,  for  example  to provide personalised recommendations or to predict reactions to movies; in medicine and healthcare, for example to detect depression, for suicide prevention or to detect autism, in education, for example to monitor attention or engagement of learners (pupils and  students  at  different  ages);  in  employment,  for  example  to  accompany  the recruitment process, to monitor emotions or boredom of employees, but also well-being applications for 'making workers happier' 149 ; for law enforcement and public safety,
146 The use of emotions for economic purposes is also referred to as 'emotionomics'.

148 See N. Lee, A. J. Broderick, &amp; L. Chamberlain, 'What is 'neuromarketing'? A discussion and agenda for future research', in International Journal of Psychophysiology , 63(2), 2007,199- 204 defining neuromarketing as a field of study as ' the application of neuroscientific methods to analyze and understand human behaviour in relation to markets and marketing exchanges ' (p. 200).
149 See E. Ackerman, &amp; E. Strickland, 'Are you Ready for Workplace Brain Scanning? Extracting and using brain data will make workers happier and more productive, backers say', IEEE Spectrum, 19  November 2022, https://spectrum.ieee.org/neurotech-workplace-innereyeemotiv  The authors explain that 'sensors detect electrical activity across different areas of the brain, and the patterns in that activity can be broadly correlated with different feelings or physiological responses, such as stress, focus, or a reaction to external stimuli'.
for example with lie detectors or emotion screening at big events; and for many other purposes.
(241) Emotion recognition is frequently doubted as to its effectiveness or as to its accuracy.
