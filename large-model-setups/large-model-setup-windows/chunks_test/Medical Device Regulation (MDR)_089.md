Active  implantable  devices  shall  be  designed  and  manufactured  in  such  a  way  as  to  remove  or  minimize  as  far as possible:
- (a)   risks  connected  with  the  use  of  energy  sources  with  particular  reference,  where  electricity  is  used,  to insulation, leakage currents and overheating of the devices,
- (b)   risks  connected  with  medical  treatment,  in  particular  those  resulting  from  the  use  of  defibrillators  or  highfrequency surgical equipment, and
- (c)   risks  which may arise where maintenance and calibration are impossible, including:
- -  excessive increase of  leakage currents,
- -  ageing of the materials used,
- -  excess heat generated by the device,
- -  decreased accuracy of any measuring or control mechanism.
