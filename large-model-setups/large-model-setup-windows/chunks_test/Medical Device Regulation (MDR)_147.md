## CLINICAL EVALUATION AND POST-MARKET CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP
PART A
## CLINICAL EVALUATION
- 1. To plan, continuously conduct and document a clinical evaluation, manufacturers shall:
- (a)   establish and update a clinical evaluation plan, which shall include at least:
- -  an  identification  of  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  that  require  support  from  relevant clinical data;
- -  a specification of the intended purpose of the device;
- -  a clear specification of intended target groups with clear indications and contra-indications;
- -  a  detailed  description  of  intended  clinical  benefits  to  patients  with  relevant  and  specified  clinical  outcome parameters;
- -  a  specification  of  methods  to  be  used  for  examination  of  qualitative  and  quantitative  aspects  of  clinical safety with clear  reference to the determination of residual risks and side-effects;
- -  an  indicative  list  and  specification  of  parameters  to  be  used  to  determine,  based  on  the  state  of  the  art  in medicine, the acceptability of  the benefit-risk ratio for  the various indications and for  the intended purpose or  purposes of the device;
- -  an  indication  how  benefit-risk  issues  relating  to  specific  components  such  as  use  of  pharmaceutical,  nonviable animal or human tissues, are to be addressed; and
- -  a  clinical  development  plan  indicating  progression  from  exploratory  investigations,  such  as  first-in-man studies,  feasibility  and  pilot  studies,  to  confirmatory  investigations,  such  as  pivotal  clinical  investigations, and  a  PMCF  as  referred  to  in  Part  B  of  this  Annex  with  an  indication  of  milestones  and  a  description  of potential acceptance criteria;
- (b)   identify  available  clinical  data  relevant  to  the  device  and  its  intended  purpose  and  any  gaps  in  clinical  evidence through a systematic scientific literature review;
- (c)   appraise  all  relevant  clinical  data  by  evaluating  their  suitability  for  establishing  the  safety  and  performance  of the device;
- (d)   generate,  through  properly  designed  clinical  investigations  in  accordance  with  the  clinical  development  plan, any new or additional clinical data necessary to address outstanding issues; and
- (e)   analyse  all  relevant  clinical  data  in  order  to  reach  conclusions  about  the  safety  and  clinical  performance  of  the device including its clinical benefits.
