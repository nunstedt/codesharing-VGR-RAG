Results  of  reviews  and  corrective  actions  carried  out  by  managers,  service,  product  or  information owners should be recorded and these records should be maintained. Managers should report the results to the persons carrying out independent reviews (see ) when an independent review takes place in the area of their responsibility.
Corrective actions should be completed in a timely manner as appropriate to the risk. If not completed by the next scheduled review, progress should at least be addressed at that review.

## Control
Operating procedures for information processing facilities should be documented and made available to personnel who need them.
## Purpose
To ensure the correct and secure operation of information processing facilities.
## Guidance
Documented procedures should be prepared for the organization's operational activities  associated with information security, for example:
- a) when the activity needs to be performed in the same way by many people;
- b) when the activity is performed rarely and when next performed the procedure is likely to have been forgotten;
- c) when the activity is new and presents a risk if not performed correctly;
- d) prior to handing over the activity to new personnel.
The operating procedures should specify:
- a) the responsible individuals;
- b) the secure installation and configuration of systems;
- c) processing and handling of information, both automated and manual;
- d) backup (see  ) and resilience;
- e) scheduling requirements, including interdependencies with other systems;
- f) instructions  for  handling  errors  or  other  exceptional  conditions  [e.g.
