## ANNEX XII
## Transparency information referred to in Article 53(1), point (b) - technical documentation for providers of general-purpose AI models to downstream providers that integrate the model into their AI system
The information referred to in Article  53(1),  point  (b)  shall  contain  at  least  the  following:
- 1. A general  description of  the  general-purpose  AI  model  including:
- (a) the  tasks  that  the  model  is  intended  to  perform  and  the  type  and  nature  of  AI  systems  into  which  it  can  be integrated;
- (b) the  acceptable  use  policies  applicable;
- (c) the  date  of  release  and  methods  of  distribution;
- (d) how the  model  interacts,  or  can  be  used  to  interact,  with  hardware  or  software  that  is  not  part  of  the  model itself,  where  applicable;
- (e) the  versions  of  relevant  software  related  to  the  use  of  the  general-purpose  AI  model,  where  applicable;
- (f) the  architecture  and  number  of  parameters;
- (g) the  modality  (e.g.  text,  image)  and  format  of  inputs  and  outputs;
- (h) the  licence  for  the  model.
- 2. A description of  the  elements  of  the  model  and  of  the  process  for  its  development,  including:
- (a) the technical means (e.g.
