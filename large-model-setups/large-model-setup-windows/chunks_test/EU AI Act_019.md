( 27 ) Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on marine equipment and repealing Council Directive  96/98/EC  (OJ  L  257,  ,  p.  146).
- ( 28 ) Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on the interoperability of the rail system within  the  European  Union (OJ  L  138,  ,  p.  44).
- ( 29 ) Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, amending Regulations  (EC)  No  715/2007  and  (EC)  No  595/2009  and  repealing  Directive  2007/46/EC  (OJ  L  151,  ,  p.  1).
European Parliament and of the Council ( 30 ), and Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 31 ),  it  is  appropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the Commission takes into account, on the basis of the technical and regulatory specificities of each sector, and without interfering with existing governance, conformity assessment  and  enforcement  mechanisms  and  authorities  established  therein,  the  mandatory  requirements  for high-risk AI systems laid down in this Regulation when adopting any relevant delegated or implementing acts on the basis  of  those  acts.
- (50) As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in an annex to this Regulation, it is appropriate  to classify them as high-risk under  this Regulation if  the product concerned undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with  a  third-party  conformity  assessment  body  pursuant  to  that  relevant  Union  harmonisation  legislation.  In particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive  atmospheres,  radio  equipment,  pressure  equipment,  recreational  craft  equipment,  cableway  installations, appliances  burning  gaseous  fuels,  medical  devices, in  vitro diagnostic  medical  devices,  automotive  and  aviation.
- (51) The  classification  of  an  AI  system  as  high-risk  pursuant  to  this  Regulation  should  not  necessarily  mean  that  the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI system itself as a product, is considered to be high-risk under the criteria established in the relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is, in particular, the case for Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, where a third-party conformity assessment is provided  for  medium-risk  and  high-risk  products.
- (52) As  regards  stand-alone  AI  systems,  namely  high-risk  AI  systems  other  than  those  that  are  safety  components  of products, or that are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk if, in light of their intended purpose,  they  pose  a  high  risk of  harm  to  the  health  and  safety or  the  fundamental  rights  of  persons,  taking  into account both the severity of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of specifically  pre-defined areas  specified  in  this  Regulation.  The  identification  of  those  systems is  based  on  the  same methodology  and  criteria  envisaged  also  for  any  future  amendments  of  the  list  of  high-risk  AI  systems  that  the Commission should be empowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of technological development, as well as  the  potential  changes  in  the  use  of  AI  systems.
