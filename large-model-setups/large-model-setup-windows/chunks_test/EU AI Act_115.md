In  addition  to  the  application  referred  to  in  point  3,  an  application  with  a  notified  body  of  their  choice  shall  be lodged  by  the  provider  for  the  assessment  of  the  technical  documentation  relating  to  the  AI  system  which  the provider intends to place on the market or put into service and which is covered by the quality management system referred  to  under  point  3.
- . The application  shall  include:
- (a) the  name  and  address  of  the  provider;
- (b) a  written  declaration  that  the  same  application  has  not  been  lodged  with  any other  notified  body;
- (c) the  technical  documentation  referred  to  in  Annex  IV.
- . The  technical  documentation  shall  be  examined  by  the  notified  body.  Where  relevant,  and  limited  to  what  is necessary to fulfil its tasks, the notified body shall be granted full access to the training, validation, and testing data sets  used,  including,  where appropriate and subject to security safeguards, through API or other  relevant technical means and tools enabling remote access.
- . In examining the technical documentation, the notified body may require that the provider supply further evidence or  carry  out  further  tests  so  as  to  enable  a  proper  assessment  of  the  conformity  of  the  AI  system  with  the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2. Where the notified body is not satisfied with the tests carried out by the  provider,  the  notified  body  shall  itself  directly  carry  out  adequate  tests,  as  appropriate.
- . Where necessary to assess the conformity of  the high-risk AI  system with the requirements  set out in Chapter III, Section  2,  after  all  other  reasonable  means  to  verify  conformity  have  been  exhausted  and  have  proven  to  be insufficient, and upon a reasoned request, the notified body shall also be granted access to the training and trained models of the AI system, including its relevant parameters. Such access shall be subject to existing Union law on the protection  of  intellectual  property  and  trade  secrets.
- . The decision of the notified body shall be notified to the provider or its authorised representative. The notification shall  contain  the  conclusions  of  the  assessment  of  the  technical  documentation  and  the  reasoned  assessment decision.
- Where the AI system is in conformity with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2, the notified body shall issue a Union technical documentation assessment certificate. The certificate shall indicate the name and address of the provider, the conclusions of the examination, the conditions (if any) for its validity and the data necessary for the identification  of  the  AI  system.
The certificate and its annexes shall contain all relevant information to allow the conformity of the AI system to be evaluated,  and  to  allow  for  control  of  the  AI  system  while  in  use,  where  applicable.
Where the AI system is not in conformity with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2, the notified body shall  refuse  to  issue  a  Union  technical  documentation  assessment  certificate  and  shall  inform  the  applicant accordingly,  giving  detailed  reasons  for  its  refusal.
- Where the AI system does not meet the requirement relating to the data used to train it, re-training of the AI system will  be  needed  prior  to  the  application  for  a  new  conformity  assessment.  In  this  case,  the  reasoned  assessment decision  of  the  notified  body  refusing  to  issue  the  Union  technical  documentation  assessment  certificate  shall contain  specific  considerations  on  the  quality  data  used  to  train  the  AI  system,  in  particular  on  the  reasons  for non-compliance.
- . Any change to the AI system that could affect the compliance of the AI system with the requirements or its intended purpose  shall  be  assessed  by  the  notified  body  which  issued  the  Union  technical  documentation  assessment certificate.  The  provider  shall  inform  such  notified  body  of  its  intention  to  introduce  any  of  the  abovementioned changes, or if it otherwise becomes aware of the occurrence of such changes. The intended changes shall be assessed by the notified body, which shall decide whether those changes require a new conformity assessment in accordance with  Article  43(4)  or  whether  they  could  be  addressed  by  means  of  a  supplement  to  the  Union  technical documentation  assessment  certificate.  In  the  latter  case,  the  notified  body  shall  assess  the  changes,  notify  the provider  of  its  decision  and,  where  the  changes  are  approved,  issue  to  the  provider  a  supplement  to  the  Union technical  documentation  assessment  certificate.
- 5. Surveillance  of  the  approved  quality  management  system.
- . The  purpose  of  the  surveillance  carried  out  by  the  notified  body  referred  to  in  Point  3  is  to  make  sure  that  the provider  duly complies  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  approved  quality  management  system.
- . For  assessment  purposes,  the  provider  shall  allow  the  notified  body  to  access  the  premises  where  the  design, development, testing of  the  AI  systems is  taking  place.  The  provider  shall  further  share  with  the  notified  body  all necessary  information.
- . The notified  body shall carry out  periodic  audits to make sure that the provider  maintains and applies the quality management system and shall provide the provider with an audit report. In the context of those audits, the notified body  may  carry  out  additional  tests  of  the  AI  systems  for  which  a  Union  technical  documentation  assessment certificate  was  issued.
