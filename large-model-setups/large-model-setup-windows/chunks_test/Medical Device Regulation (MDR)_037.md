The  sampling  of  files  to  be  reviewed  in  accordance  with  paragraph  1  shall  be  planned  and  representative  of  the types and risk of devices certified  by the  notified  body,  in particular  high-risk  devices,  and  be appropriately  justified  and documented  in  a  sampling  plan,  which  shall  be  made  available  by  the  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  to  the MDCG upon request.
- 3. The  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  shall  review  whether  the  assessment  by  the  notified  body  was conducted  appropriately  and  shall  check  the  procedures  used,  associated  documentation  and  the  conclusions  drawn  by the notified  body. Such checking shall include the technical documentation and clinical evaluation documentation of  the manufacturer upon which the notified body has based its assessment. Such reviews shall be conducted utilising CS.
- 4. Those  reviews  shall  also  form  part  of  the  re-assessment  of  notified  bodies  in  accordance  with  Article  44(10)  and the joint assessment activities referred to in Article 47(3). The reviews shall be conducted utilising appropriate expertise.
- 5. Based  on  the  reports  of  the  reviews  and  assessments  by  the  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  or  joint assessment  teams,  on  input  from  the  market  surveillance,  vigilance  and  post-market  surveillance  activities  described  in Chapter  VII,  on  the  continuous  monitoring  of  technical  progress,  or  on  the  identification  of  concerns  and  emerging issues  concerning  the  safety  and  performance  of  devices,  the  MDCG  may  recommend  that  the  sampling,  carried  out under  this  Article,  cover  a  greater  or  lesser  proportion  of  the  technical  documentation  and  clinical  evaluation  documenÂ­ tation assessed by a notified body.
- 6. The  Commission  may,  by  means  of  implementing  acts,  adopt  measures  setting  out  the  detailed  arrangements, associated  documents  for,  and  coordination  of,  the  review  of  assessments  of  technical  documentation  and  clinical evaluation  documentation,  as  referred  to  in  this  Article.  Those  implementing  acts  shall  be  adopted  in  accordance  with the examination procedure referred to in Article 114(3).
## Article 46
## Changes to designations and notifications
- 1. The  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  shall  notify  the  Commission  and  the  other  Member  States  of  any relevant changes to the designation of a notified body.
The procedures described in Article 39 and in Article 42 shall apply to extensions of the scope of the designation.
For changes to the designation other  than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid down in the following paragraphs shall apply. - 2. The  Commission shall immediately publish the amended  notification in NANDO.  The  Commission  shall immediately  enter  information  on  the  changes  to  the  designation  of  the  notified  body  in  the  electronic  system  referred to in Article 57.
- 3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities it shall inform the authority responsible for  notified  bodies  and  the  manufacturers concerned as soon as possible and in the case of a planned cessation one year before  ceasing  its  activities.  The  certificates  may  remain  valid  for  a  temporary  period  of  nine  months  after  cessation  of the  notified  body's  activities  on  condition  that  another  notified  body  has  confirmed  in  writing  that  it  will  assume responsibilities  for  the  devices  covered  by  those  certificates.  The  new  notified  body  shall  complete  a  full  assessment  of the  devices  affected  by  the  end  of  that  period  before  issuing  new  certificates  for  those  devices.  Where  the  notified  body has ceased its activity, the authority responsible for notified bodies shall withdraw the designation.
- 4. Where  a  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  has  ascertained  that  a  notified  body  no  longer  meets  the requirements  set  out  in  Annex  VII,  or  that  it  is  failing  to  fulfil  its  obligations  or  has  not  implemented  the  necessary corrective  measures,  the  authority  shall  suspend,  restrict,  or  fully  or  partially  withdraw  the  designation,  depending  on the  seriousness  of  the  failure  to  meet  those  requirements  or  fulfil  those  obligations.  A  suspension  shall  not  exceed a period of one year, renewable once for  the same period.
The authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  shall  immediately  inform  the  Commission  and  the  other  Member  States of any suspension, restriction or  withdrawal of a designation.
- 5. Where  its  designation  has  been  suspended,  restricted,  or  fully  or  partially  withdrawn,  the  notified  body  shall inform the manufacturers concerned at the latest within 10 days.
- 6. In  the  event  of  restriction,  suspension  or  withdrawal  of a  designation,  the  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies shall  take  appropriate  steps  to  ensure  that  the  files  of  the  notified  body  concerned  are  kept  and  make  them  available  to authorities  in  other  Member  States  responsible  for  notified  bodies  and  to  authorities  responsible  for  market  surveillance at their  request.
- 7. In  the  event  of  restriction,  suspension  or  withdrawal  of a  designation,  the  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies shall:
- (a)   assess  the impact on the certificates issued by the notified body;
- (b)   submit  a  report  on  its  findings  to  the  Commission  and  the  other  Member  States  within  three  months  of  having notified the changes to the designation;
- (c)   require  the  notified  body  to  suspend  or  withdraw,  within  a  reasonable  period  of  time  determined  by  the  authority, any certificates which were unduly issued to ensure the safety of devices on the market;
- (d)   enter  into  the  electronic  system  referred  to  in  Article  57  information  in  relation  to  certificates  of  which  it  has required their suspension or  withdrawal;
- (e)   inform  the  competent  authority  for  medical  devices  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  manufacturer  has  its registered place of business through the electronic system referred to in Article 57 of the certificates for  which it has required  suspension  or  withdrawal.  That  competent  authority  shall  take  the  appropriate  measures,  where  necessary to avoid a potential risk to the health or safety of patients, users or others.
- 8. With  the  exception  of  certificates  unduly  issued,  and  where  a  designation  has  been  suspended  or  restricted,  the certificates shall remain valid in the following circumstances:
- (a)   the  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  has  confirmed,  within  one  month  of  the  suspension  or  restriction,  that there  is  no  safety  issue  in  relation  to  certificates  affected  by  the  suspension  or  restriction,  and  the  authority responsible  for notified bodies  has  outlined  a  timeline  and  actions  anticipated  to  remedy  the  suspension  or restriction; or
- (b)   the  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  has  confirmed  that  no  certificates  relevant  to  the  suspension  will  be issued, amended or re-issued during the course of the suspension or restriction, and states whether  the notified body has  the  capability  of  continuing  to  monitor  and  remain  responsible  for  existing  certificates  issued  for  the  period  of the  suspension  or  restriction.  In  the  event  that  the  authority  responsible  for  notified  bodies  determines  that  the notified  body  does  not  have  the  capability  to  support  existing  certificates  issued,  the  manufacturer  shall  provide,  to the  competent  authority  for  medical  devices  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  manufacturer  of  the  device  covered by the  certificate  has  its  registered  place  of  business,  within  three  months  of  the  suspension  or  restriction,  a  written confirmation  that  another  qualified  notified  body  is  temporarily  assuming  the  functions  of  the  notified  body  to monitor and remain responsible for the certificates during the period of suspension or restriction. - 9. With the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a designation has been withdrawn, the certificates shall remain valid for a period of nine months in the following circumstances:
- (a)   where  the  competent  authority  for  medical  devices  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  manufacturer  of  the  device covered  by  the  certificate  has  its  registered  place  of  business  has  confirmed  that  there  is  no  safety  issue  associated with the devices in question; and
- (b)   another  notified  body  has  confirmed  in  writing  that  it  will  assume  immediate  responsibilities  for  those  devices  and will have completed assessment of them within twelve months of the withdrawal of the designation.
In the circumstances  referred to in the first  subparagraph,  the  competent  authority  for medical  devices of the Member State in which the manufacturer of the device covered by the certificate has its place of business may extend the provisional validity of the certificates for further periods of three months, which altogether shall not exceed twelve months.
The  authority  or  the  notified  body  assuming  the  functions  of  the  notified  body  affected  by  the  change  of  designation shall immediately inform the Commission, the other Member States and the other notified bodies thereof.
