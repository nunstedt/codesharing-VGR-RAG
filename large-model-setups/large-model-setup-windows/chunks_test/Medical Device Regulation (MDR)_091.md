- -  ensure that the  device  can  be  used  safely and  accurately  by the  intended  user  at  all  stages  of  the  procedure, if  necessary after appropriate training and/or information,
- -  reduce,  as  far  as  possible  and  appropriate,  the  risk  from  unintended  cuts  and  pricks  such  as  needle  stick injuries, and
- -  reduce  as  far  as  possible  the  risk  of  error  by  the  intended  user  in  the  handling  of  the  device  and,  if applicable, in the interpretation of  the results.
- . Devices for use by lay persons shall, where appropriate, include a procedure by which the lay person:
- -  can verify that, at the time of use, the device will perform as intended by the manufacturer, and
- -  if applicable, is warned if the device has failed to provide a valid result.
## CHAPTER III
## REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE INFORMATION SUPPLIED WITH THE DEVICE
- 23. Label and instructions for use
- . General requirements regarding the information supplied by the manufacturer
Each  device  shall  be  accompanied  by  the  information  needed  to  identify  the  device  and  its  manufacturer,  and by  any  safety  and  performance  information  relevant  to  the  user,  or  any  other  person,  as  appropriate.  Such information  may  appear  on  the  device  itself,  on  the  packaging  or  in  the  instructions  for  use,  and  shall,  if  the manufacturer  has  a  website,  be  made  available  and  kept  up  to  date  on  the  website,  taking  into  account  the following:
- (a)   The medium,  format,  content,  legibility, and  location  of the label and  instructions  for use shall be appropriate to the particular device, its intended purpose  and  the technical knowledge,  experience, education  or  training  of  the  intended  user(s).  In  particular,  instructions  for  use  shall  be  written  in  terms readily understood by the intended user and,  where appropriate,  supplemented  with drawings and diagrams.
- (b)   The  information  required  on  the  label  shall  be  provided  on  the  device  itself.  If  this  is  not  practicable  or appropriate,  some  or  all  of  the  information  may  appear  on  the  packaging  for  each  unit,  and/or  on  the packaging of multiple devices.
- (c)   Labels  shall  be  provided  in  a  human-readable  format  and  may  be  supplemented  by  machine-readable information, such as radio-frequency identification ('RFID') or bar codes.
- (d)   Instructions  for  use  shall  be  provided  together  with  devices.  By  way  of  exception,  instructions  for  use  shall not  be  required  for  class  I  and  class  IIa  devices  if  such  devices  can  be  used  safely  without  any  such instructions and unless otherwise provided for elsewhere in this Section.
- (e)   Where  multiple  devices  are  supplied  to  a  single  user  and/or  location,  a  single  copy  of  the  instructions  for use  may  be  provided  if  so  agreed  by  the  purchaser  who  in  any  case  may  request  further  copies  to  be provided free of charge.
- (f)   Instructions  for  use  may  be  provided  to  the  user  in  non-paper  format  (e.g.  electronic)  to  the  extent,  and only  under  the  conditions,  set  out  in  Regulation  (EU)  No  207/2012  or  in  any  subsequent  implementing rules adopted pursuant to this Regulation.
