As far as possible, protective security measures must be designed so they do not result in harm or inconvenience to other public or private interests. Act 2021:952.
## Protective security measures
## Section 2
Information security is intended to:
- 1. prevent classified information being improperly disclosed, altered, made unavailable or destroyed; and
- 2. prevent other harmful impacts on information and information systems relating to security-sensitive activities.
## Section 3
Physical security is intended to:
- 1. prevent unauthorised persons obtaining access to areas, buildings and other facilities or objects where they might access classified information or where securitysensitive activities are otherwise conducted; and
- 2. prevent harmful impacts on areas, buildings, facilities or objects referred to in point 1.
## Section 4
Personnel security is intended to:
- 1. prevent persons who are not reliable from a security standpoint participating in activities where they might access classified information or in activities that are security-sensitive for some other reason; and
- 2. ensure that those who participate in security-sensitive activities have sufficient knowledge of protective security.
## Security classification
## Section 5
Classified information is divided into security classification levels based on the harm that disclosing the information could cause to Sweden's security. Security classification levels are assigned as follows:
- 1. top secret for exceptionally serious damage;
- 2. secret for serious damage;
- 3. confidential for not insignificant damage; or
- 4. restricted for only minor damage.
Classified information that is covered by an international protective security commitment is correspondingly divided into security classification levels if it has not already been classified by another state or an international organisation. In such cases, security classification levels are assigned based on the damage that disclosure of the information could cause to Sweden's relations with another state or an international organisation.
## Obligation to notify
## Section 6
An operator must without delay notify the supervisory authority of the fact that it is conducting security-sensitive activities.
When the security-sensitive activities cease, the operator must notify the supervisory authority of this without delay. Act 2021:952.
## Protective security manager
## Section 7
Activities covered by this Act must have a protective security manager unless this is manifestly unnecessary.
The protective security manager leads and coordinates the protective security work and undertakes controls of the activities' compliance with this Act and any regulations issued in connection with it.
