Gunnar is a system designed to assist with the triage of patients within the Emergency Room (ER) at VGR. It is intended for use by internal staff only and is accessible solely through the internal network. The system processes personal data. Gunnar is hosted on-premise and does not utilize any AI components. Its criticality is considered low, meaning that a loss of the system would only result in a minor impact.
