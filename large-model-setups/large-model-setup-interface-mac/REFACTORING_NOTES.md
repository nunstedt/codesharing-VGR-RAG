# Code Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
The codebase has been refactored to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and follow the Single Responsibility Principle. The large monolithic functions have been split into smaller, focused modules.

## New Module Structure

### 1. `config.py`
**Purpose**: Centralized configuration management
- LLM setup and configuration
- Model name and API key management
- Data directory configuration
- Eliminates global configuration scattered across files

### 2. `data_init.py`
**Purpose**: Data initialization and setup
- Handles data parsing and vector index creation
- Includes timing and progress reporting
- Centralizes the data loading process that was previously inline in main.py

### 3. `profile_manager.py`
**Purpose**: System profile management
- System profile creation and saving
- Profile selection and loading
- System summary generation
- File I/O operations for profiles

### 4. `query_handler.py`
**Purpose**: Query processing utilities
- Language detection
- Metadata filter processing
- Chat command handling (exit, quit, reset)
- Query execution with fallback mechanisms
- Response display formatting

### 5. `chat_session.py`
**Purpose**: Chat session management
- Base `ChatSession` class with common functionality
- `ComplianceChatSession` for system-aware compliance questions
- `QAChatSession` for general Q&A
- Eliminates code duplication between compliance and QA modes

### 6. `mode_logic.py` (Refactored)
**Purpose**: High-level mode orchestration
- Clean, simple functions for each mode
- Uses composition instead of large monolithic functions
- Much shorter and more readable

### 7. `main.py` (Simplified)
**Purpose**: Application entry point
- Simplified initialization
- Clean menu handling
- Uses the new modular structure

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Eliminated Code Duplication**
- The original `run_compliance_mode` and `run_qa_mode` had ~80% identical code
- Now they both use the same `ChatSession` base class with specialized subclasses
- Query processing logic is shared through `query_handler.py`

### 2. **Single Responsibility Principle**
- Each module has one clear purpose
- Functions are smaller and more focused
- Easier to test and modify individual components

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Centralized error handling in query execution
- Consistent fallback mechanisms
- Better separation of concerns

### 4. **Improved Maintainability**
- Changes to chat logic only need to be made in one place
- Configuration changes are centralized
- Each module can be modified independently

### 5. **Enhanced Readability**
- Functions are shorter and easier to understand
- Clear module boundaries
- Better naming conventions

## Migration Benefits

### Before Refactoring:
- `mode_logic.py`: 264 lines with complex, duplicated functions
- Configuration scattered across files
- Large functions with multiple responsibilities
- Difficult to test individual components

### After Refactoring:
- `mode_logic.py`: ~40 lines with simple, focused functions
- 6 additional specialized modules with clear purposes
- Each function has a single responsibility
- Easy to test and modify individual components

## Usage
The external API remains the same - `main.py` still provides the same three modes:
1. Profile mode - Add and describe a system
2. Compliance mode - Ask compliance questions
3. QA mode - General regulation exploration

All functionality is preserved while significantly improving code organization and maintainability.

## Future Enhancements
With this modular structure, it's now easier to:
- Add new chat modes
- Implement different prompt strategies
- Add new data sources
- Implement different LLM backends
- Add comprehensive testing
- Implement caching mechanisms
