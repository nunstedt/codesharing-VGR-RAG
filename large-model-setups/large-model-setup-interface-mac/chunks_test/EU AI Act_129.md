instructions for use, infrastructure, tools) required for the general-purpose AI model to be  integrated  into  AI  systems;
- (b) the modality (e.g. text, image, etc.) and format of  the inputs and outputs and their  maximum size (e.g. context window length, etc.);
- (c) information  on  the  data  used  for  training,  testing  and  validation,  where  applicable,  including  the  type  and provenance of data  and  curation  methodologies.
## Criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk referred to in Article 51
For the purpose of determining that a general-purpose AI model has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those set out in Article  51(1),  point  (a),  the  Commission  shall  take  into  account  the  following  criteria:
- (a) the  number of  parameters  of  the  model;
- (b) the  quality  or  size  of  the  data  set,  for  example  measured  through  tokens;
- (c) the  amount  of  computation  used  for  training  the  model,  measured  in  floating  point  operations  or  indicated  by a  combination  of  other  variables  such  as  estimated  cost  of  training,  estimated  time  required  for  the  training,  or estimated energy consumption for  the training;
- (d) the  input  and  output  modalities  of  the  model,  such  as  text  to  text  (large  language  models),  text  to  image, multi-modality, and the state of  the art thresholds for determining high-impact capabilities for each modality, and the  specific  type  of  inputs  and  outputs  (e.g.  biological  sequences);
- (e) the  benchmarks  and  evaluations  of  capabilities  of  the  model,  including  considering  the  number  of  tasks  without additional  training,  adaptability  to  learn  new,  distinct  tasks,  its  level  of  autonomy  and  scalability,  the  tools  it  has access  to;
- (f) whether  it  has  a  high  impact  on  the  internal  market  due  to  its  reach,  which  shall  be  presumed  when  it  has  been made available  to at  least  10 000  registered  business  users  established  in  the  Union;
- (g) the  number of  registered  end-users.
