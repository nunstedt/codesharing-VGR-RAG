A UDI shall be assigned to the configurable device in its entirety and shall be called the configurable device UDI.
- . The  configurable  device  UDI-DI  shall  be  assigned  to  groups  of  configurations,  not  per  configuration  within  the group.  A  group  of  configurations  is  defined  as  the  collection  of  possible  configurations  for  a  given  device  as described in the technical documentation.
- . A configurable device UDI-PI shall be assigned to each individual configurable device.
- . The carrier of  the configurable device UDI shall be placed on the assembly that is most unlikely to be exchanged during the lifetime of the system and shall be identified as the configurable device UDI.
- . Each component that is considered a device and is commercially available on its own shall be assigned a separate UDI.
- . Device Software
- . UDI assignment Criteria
The UDI shall be assigned at the system level of  the software. Only software  which is  commercially available on its  own and software which constitutes a device in itself shall be subject to that requirement.
The  software  identification  shall  be  considered  to  be  the  manufacturing  control  mechanism  and  shall  be displayed in the UDI-PI.
- . A new UDI-DI shall be required whenever there is a modification that changes:
- (a)   the  original performance;
- (b)   the  safety or  the  intended use of  the software;
- (c)   interpretation of data.
Such modifications  include  new  or  modified  algorithms,  database  structures,  operating  platform,  architecture  or new user interfaces or new channels for interoperability.
- . Minor software revisions shall require a new UDI-PI and not a new UDI-DI.
Minor  software  revisions  are  generally  associated  with  bug  fixes,  usability  enhancements  that  are  not  for  safety purposes, security patches or operating efficiency.
Minor software revisions shall be identified by a manufacturer-specific form of identification.
## . UDI placement criteria for software
- (a)   where  the  software  is  delivered  on  a  physical  medium,  e.g.  CD  or  DVD,  each  packaging  level  shall  bear  the human  readable  and  AIDC  representation  of  the  complete  UDI.  The  UDI  that  is  applied  to  the  physical medium containing the software  and its  packaging  shall  be  identical  to  the  UDI  assigned  to  the  system  level software;
- (b)   the  UDI  shall  be  provided  on  a  readily  accessible  screen  for  the  user  in  an  easily-readable  plain-text  format, such as an 'about' file, or  included on the start-up screen;
- (c)   software  lacking  a  user  interface  such  as  middleware  for  image  conversion,  shall  be  capable  of  transmitting the UDI through an application programming interface (API);
- (d)   only  the  human  readable  portion  of  the  UDI  shall  be  required  in  electronic  displays  of  the  software.  The marking  of  UDI  using  AIDC  shall  not  be  required  in  the  electronic  displays,  such  as  'about'  menu,  splash screen etc.;
- (e)   the  human  readable  format  of  the  UDI  for  the  software  shall  include  the  Application  Identifiers  (AI)  for  the standard  used  by  the  issuing  entities,  so  as  to  assist  the  user  in  identifying  the  UDI  and  determining  which standard is being used to create the UDI. ## ANNEX VII
## REQUIREMENTS TO BE MET BY NOTIFIED BODIES
- 1. ORGANISATIONAL AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
- . Legal status and organisational structure
- .   Each  notified  body  shall  be  established  under  the  national  law  of  a  Member  State,  or  under  the  law  of  a  third country with which the Union has concluded an agreement in this respect. Its legal personality and status shall be fully  documented.
