cleaning,  filtering,  etc.),  the  number  of  data  points,  their scope and main characteristics; how the data was obtained and selected as well as all other measures to detect the unsuitability of  data  sources  and  methods  to  detect  identifiable  biases,  where  applicable;
- (d) the  computational resources  used  to train  the  model  (e.g.  number  of  floating  point  operations),  training  time, and other  relevant  details  related  to  the  training;
- (e) known or estimated energy consumption of  the model.
With regard to point (e), where the energy consumption of the model is unknown, the energy consumption may be based  on  information  about  computational  resources  used.
## Section  2
Additional  information  to  be  provided  by  providers  of  general-purpose  AI  models  with  systemic  risk
- 1. A  detailed  description  of  the  evaluation  strategies,  including  evaluation  results,  on  the  basis  of  available  public evaluation protocols  and  tools  or  otherwise  of other  evaluation  methodologies.  Evaluation  strategies  shall  include evaluation  criteria,  metrics  and  the  methodology on  the  identification  of  limitations.
