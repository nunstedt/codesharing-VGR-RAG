## Article  29
## Application of a conformity assessment body for notification
- 1. Conformity assessment bodies shall submit an application for notification to the notifying authority of the Member State  in  which  they  are  established.
- 2. The  application  for  notification  shall  be  accompanied  by  a  description  of  the  conformity  assessment  activities,  the conformity assessment module or modules and the types of AI systems for which the conformity assessment body claims to be competent, as well as by an accreditation certificate, where one exists, issued by a national accreditation body attesting that  the  conformity  assessment  body  fulfils  the  requirements  laid  down  in  Article  31.
Any valid document related to existing designations of the applicant notified body under any other Union harmonisation legislation  shall  be  added.
- 3. Where  the  conformity  assessment  body  concerned  cannot  provide  an  accreditation  certificate,  it  shall  provide  the notifying authority with all the documentary evidence necessary for the verification, recognition and regular monitoring of its  compliance  with  the  requirements  laid  down  in  Article  31.
- 4. For  notified  bodies  which  are  designated  under  any  other  Union  harmonisation  legislation,  all  documents  and certificates  linked  to  those  designations  may  be  used  to  support  their  designation  procedure  under  this  Regulation,  as appropriate. The notified body shall update the documentation referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article whenever relevant changes occur, in order  to enable the authority responsible for  notified  bodies to monitor and verify continuous compliance with all  the  requirements  laid  down in  Article  31.
## Article  30
## Notification procedure
- 1. Notifying authorities may notify only conformity assessment bodies which have satisfied the requirements laid down in  Article  31.
- 2. Notifying authorities shall notify the Commission and the other Member States, using the electronic notification tool developed and managed by the Commission, of each conformity assessment body referred to in paragraph 1.
- 3. The  notification  referred  to  in  paragraph  2  of  this  Article  shall  include  full  details  of  the  conformity  assessment activities, the conformity assessment module or modules, the types of AI systems concerned, and the relevant attestation of competence. Where a notification is not based on an accreditation certificate as referred to in Article 29(2), the notifying authority  shall  provide  the  Commission  and  the  other  Member  States  with  documentary  evidence  which  attests  to  the competence  of  the  conformity  assessment  body  and  to  the  arrangements  in  place  to  ensure  that  that  body  will  be monitored regularly  and  will  continue  to  satisfy  the  requirements  laid  down  in  Article  31.
- 4. The conformity assessment body concerned may perform the activities of a notified body only where no objections are raised by the Commission or the other Member States within two weeks of a notification by a notifying authority where it  includes an accreditation certificate referred to in Article 29(2), or  within two months of a notification by the notifying authority  where  it  includes  documentary evidence  referred  to  in  Article  29(3).
- 5. Where objections are raised, the Commission shall, without delay, enter into consultations with the relevant Member States  and  the  conformity  assessment  body.  In  view  thereof,  the  Commission  shall  decide  whether  the  authorisation  is justified.  The  Commission  shall  address  its  decision  to  the  Member  State  concerned  and  to  the  relevant  conformity assessment  body.
## Article  31
## Requirements relating to notified bodies
- 1. A notified  body  shall  be  established  under  the  national  law of  a  Member  State  and  shall  have  legal  personality.
- 2. Notified  bodies  shall  satisfy  the  organisational,  quality  management,  resources  and  process  requirements  that  are necessary  to  fulfil  their  tasks,  as  well  as  suitable  cybersecurity  requirements.

- 4. Notified  bodies  shall  be  independent  of  the  provider  of  a  high-risk  AI  system  in  relation  to  which  they  perform conformity  assessment  activities.  Notified  bodies  shall  also  be  independent  of  any  other  operator  having  an  economic interest  in  high-risk  AI  systems  assessed,  as  well  as  of  any competitors  of  the  provider.  This  shall  not  preclude  the  use  of assessed high-risk AI systems that are necessary for  the operations of  the conformity assessment body, or  the use of such high-risk  AI  systems  for  personal  purposes.
- 5. Neither  a  conformity  assessment  body,  its  top-level  management  nor  the  personnel  responsible  for  carrying  out  its conformity assessment tasks shall be directly involved in the design, development, marketing or use of high-risk AI systems, nor shall they represent the parties engaged in those activities. They shall not engage in any activity that might conflict with their  independence  of  judgement  or  integrity  in  relation  to  conformity  assessment  activities  for  which  they  are  notified. This  shall,  in  particular,  apply  to  consultancy  services.
- 6. Notified bodies shall be organised and operated so as to safeguard the independence, objectivity and impartiality of their activities. Notified bodies shall document and implement a structure and procedures to safeguard impartiality and to promote and apply the principles of  impartiality  throughout  their  organisation,  personnel  and  assessment  activities.
- 7. Notified  bodies  shall  have  documented  procedures  in  place  ensuring  that  their  personnel,  committees,  subsidiaries, subcontractors  and  any  associated  body  or  personnel  of  external  bodies  maintain,  in  accordance  with  Article  78,  the confidentiality  of  the  information  which  comes  into  their  possession  during  the  performance  of  conformity  assessment activities, except when its disclosure is required by law. The staff of notified bodies shall be bound to observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their  tasks under  this Regulation, except in relation to the notifying  authorities  of  the  Member  State  in  which  their  activities  are  carried  out.
- 8. Notified  bodies  shall  have  procedures  for  the  performance  of  activities  which  take  due  account  of  the  size  of a  provider,  the  sector  in  which  it  operates,  its  structure,  and  the  degree  of  complexity  of  the  AI  system  concerned.
- 9. Notified bodies shall take out appropriate liability insurance for their conformity assessment activities, unless liability is assumed by the Member State in which they are established in accordance with national law or that Member State is itself directly  responsible  for  the  conformity  assessment.
- 10. Notified  bodies  shall  be  capable  of  carrying  out  all  their  tasks  under  this  Regulation  with  the  highest  degree  of professional  integrity  and  the  requisite  competence  in  the  specific  field,  whether  those  tasks  are  carried  out  by  notified bodies  themselves  or  on  their  behalf  and  under  their  responsibility.
- 11. Notified bodies shall have sufficient  internal  competences to be able effectively to evaluate the tasks  conducted by external parties on their behalf. The notified body shall have permanent availability of sufficient administrative, technical, legal and scientific personnel who possess experience and knowledge relating to the relevant types of AI systems, data and data  computing,  and  relating  to  the  requirements  set  out  in  Section  2.
- 12. Notified  bodies  shall  participate  in  coordination  activities  as  referred  to  in  Article  38.  They  shall  also  take  part directly,  or  be  represented  in,  European  standardisation  organisations,  or  ensure  that  they  are  aware  and  up  to  date  in respect  of  relevant  standards.
## Article  32
## Presumption of conformity with requirements relating to notified bodies
Where a conformity assessment body demonstrates its conformity with the criteria laid down in the relevant harmonised standards or parts thereof, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union ,  it  shall be presumed to comply with the requirements set out in Article 31 in so far as the applicable harmonised standards cover those  requirements.
## Article  33
## Subsidiaries of  notified  bodies  and  subcontracting
- 1. Where  a  notified  body  subcontracts  specific  tasks  connected  with  the  conformity  assessment  or  has  recourse  to a  subsidiary,  it  shall  ensure  that  the  subcontractor  or  the  subsidiary  meets  the  requirements  laid  down  in  Article  31,  and shall  inform  the  notifying  authority  accordingly.
- 2. Notified  bodies  shall  take  full  responsibility  for  the  tasks  performed  by  any  subcontractors  or  subsidiaries.
- 3. Activities  may  be  subcontracted  or  carried  out  by  a  subsidiary  only  with  the  agreement  of  the  provider.  Notified bodies  shall  make  a  list  of  their  subsidiaries  publicly  available.
- 4. The relevant documents concerning the assessment of  the qualifications of  the subcontractor or  the subsidiary and the work carried out by them under this Regulation shall be kept at the disposal of the notifying authority for a period of five  years  from  the  termination  date  of  the  subcontracting.
## Article  34
## Operational obligations of notified bodies
- 1. Notified  bodies  shall  verify  the  conformity  of  high-risk  AI  systems  in  accordance  with  the  conformity  assessment procedures set out  in  Article  43.
- 2. Notified bodies shall avoid unnecessary burdens for providers when performing their activities, and take due account of  the  size  of  the  provider,  the  sector  in  which  it  operates,  its  structure  and  the  degree  of  complexity of  the  high-risk  AI system concerned, in particular  in view of minimising administrative burdens and compliance costs for  micro- and small enterprises within the meaning of Recommendation 2003/361/EC. The notified body shall, nevertheless, respect the degree of rigour and the level of protection required for  the compliance of the high-risk AI system with the requirements of this Regulation.
- 3. Notified  bodies  shall  make  available  and  submit  upon  request  all  relevant  documentation,  including  the  providers' documentation,  to  the  notifying  authority  referred  to  in  Article  28  to  allow  that  authority  to  conduct  its  assessment, designation,  notification  and  monitoring  activities,  and  to  facilitate  the  assessment  outlined  in  this  Section.
## Article  35
## Identification numbers and lists  of  notified  bodies
- 1. The Commission shall assign a single identification number to each notified body, even where a body is notified under more than one Union act.
- 2. The  Commission  shall  make  publicly  available  the  list  of  the  bodies  notified  under  this  Regulation,  including  their identification numbers and the activities for which they have been notified. The Commission shall ensure that the list is kept up to  date.
