## Guidance
## Provision and revocation of access rights
The provisioning process for assigning or revoking physical and logical access rights granted to an entity's authenticated identity should include:
- a) obtaining authorization from the owner of the information and other associated assets for the use of  the  information  and  other  associated  assets  (see  ).  Separate  approval  for  access  rights  by management can also be appropriate;
- b) considering  the  business  requirements  and  the  organization's  topic-specific  policy  and  rules  on access control;
- c) considering segregation of duties, including segregating the roles of approval and implementation of the access rights and separation of conflicting roles;
- d) ensuring access rights are removed when someone does not need to access the information and other associated assets, in particular ensuring access rights of users who have left the organization are removed in a timely fashion;
- e) considering  giving  temporary  access  rights  for  a  limited  time  period  and  revoking  them  at  the expiration date, in particular for temporary personnel or temporary access required by personnel;
- f) verifying  that  the  level  of  access  granted  is  in  accordance  with  the  topic-specific  policies  on access control (see ) and is consistent with other information security requirements such as segregation of duties (see  );
- g) ensuring  that  access  rights  are  activated  (e.g.  by  service  providers)  only  after  authorization procedures are successfully completed;
- h) maintaining a central record of access rights granted to a user identifier (ID, logical or physical) to access information and other associated assets;
- i) modifying access rights of users who have changed roles or jobs;
- j) removing or adjusting physical and logical access rights, which can be done by removal, revocation or replacement of keys, authentication information, identification cards or subscriptions;
- k) maintaining a record of changes to users' logical and physical access rights.
## Review of access rights
Regular reviews of physical and logical access rights should consider the following:
- a) users'  access  rights  after  any  change  within  the  same  organization  (e.g.  job  change,  promotion, demotion) or termination of employment (see  to  );
- b) authorizations for privileged access rights.
## Consideration before change or termination of employment
A user's access rights to information and other associated assets should be reviewed and adjusted or removed before any change or termination of employment based on the evaluation of risk factors such as:
- a) whether the termination or change is initiated by the user or by management and the reason for termination;
- b) the current responsibilities of the user;
- c) the value of the assets currently accessible.
## Other information
Consideration should be given to establishing user access roles based on business requirements that summarize a number of access rights into typical user access profiles. Access requests and reviews of access rights are easier managed at the level of such roles than at the level of particular rights.
Consideration should be given to including clauses in personnel contracts and service contracts that specify sanctions if unauthorized access is attempted by personnel (see , , , ).
