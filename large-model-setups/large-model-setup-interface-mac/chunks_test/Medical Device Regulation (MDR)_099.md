DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING INFORMATION
- (a)   information to allow the design stages applied to the device to be understood;
- (b)   complete  information  and  specifications,  including  the  manufacturing  processes  and  their  validation,  their adjuvants, the continuous monitoring and the final product testing. Data shall be fully included in the technical documentation;
- (c)   identification  of all  sites,  including  suppliers  and  sub-contractors,  where  design  and  manufacturing activities  are performed.
## 4. GENERAL SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
The  documentation  shall  contain  information  for  the  demonstration  of  conformity  with  the  general  safety  and performance  requirements  set  out  in  Annex  I  that  are  applicable  to  the  device  taking  into  account  its  intended purpose,  and  shall  include  a  justification,  validation  and  verification  of  the  solutions  adopted  to  meet  those requirements. The demonstration of conformity shall include:
- (a)   the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  that  apply  to  the  device  and  an  explanation  as  to why others do not apply;
- (b)   the  method  or  methods  used  to  demonstrate  conformity  with  each  applicable  general  safety  and  performance requirement;
- (c)   the  harmonised standards, CS or other solutions applied; and
- (d)   the  precise  identity  of  the  controlled  documents  offering  evidence  of  conformity  with  each  harmonised standard,  CS  or  other  method  applied  to  demonstrate  conformity  with  the  general  safety  and  performance requirements. The information referred to under  this point shall incorporate a cross-reference to the location of such evidence within the full technical documentation and, if applicable, the summary technical documentation.
## 5. BENEFIT-RISK ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The documentation shall contain information on:
- (a)   the  benefit-risk analysis referred to in Sections 1 and 8 of Annex I, and
- (b)   the  solutions adopted and the results of  the risk management referred to in Section 3 of Annex I.
## 6. PRODUCT VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION
The  documentation  shall  contain  the  results  and  critical  analyses  of  all  verifications  and  validation  tests  and/or studies  undertaken  to  demonstrate  conformity  of  the  device  with  the  requirements  of  this  Regulation  and  in particular  the applicable general safety and performance requirements.
## .   Pre-clinical and clinical data
- (a)   results  of  tests,  such  as  engineering,  laboratory,  simulated  use  and  animal  tests,  and  evaluation  of  published literature  applicable  to  the  device,  taking  into  account  its  intended  purpose,  or  to  similar  devices,  regarding  the pre-clinical safety of  the device and its conformity with the specifications;
- (b)   detailed  information  regarding  test  design,  complete  test  or  study  protocols,  methods  of  data  analysis,  in addition to data summaries and test conclusions regarding in particular:
- -  the  biocompatibility  of  the  device  including  the  identification  of  all  materials  in  direct  or  indirect  contact with the patient or user;
- -  physical, chemical and microbiological characterisation;
- -  electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility;
- -  software  verification  and  validation  (describing  the  software  design  and  development  process  and  evidence of  the  validation  of  the  software,  as  used  in  the  finished  device.  This  information  shall  typically  include  the summary  results  of  all  verification,  validation  and  testing  performed  both  in-house  and  in  a  simulated  or actual  user  environment  prior  to  final  release.  It  shall  also  address  all  of  the  different  hardware  configÂ­ urations and, where applicable, operating systems identified in the information supplied by the manufacturer);
- -  stability, including shelf  life; and
- -  performance and safety.
Where applicable,  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  Directive  2004/10/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of the Council  ( 1 )  shall  be  demonstrated.
Where no  new  testing  has  been  undertaken,  the  documentation  shall  incorporate  a  rationale  for  that  decision. An  example  of  such  a  rationale  would  be  that  biocompatibility  testing  on  identical  materials  was  conducted when those materials were incorporated in a previous version of  the device that has been  legally  placed on the market or put into service;
- (c)   the  clinical  evaluation  report  and  its  updates  and  the  clinical  evaluation  plan  referred  to  in  Article  61(12)  and Part A of Annex XIV;
- (d)   the  PMCF  plan  and  PMCF evaluation report referred to in Part B of Annex XIV or a justification why a PMCF is not applicable.
