However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such use for the purpose of  law enforcement  set  by  this  Regulation.  Such  use  for  purposes  other  than  law  enforcement  should  therefore  not  be subject to the requirement of an authorisation under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that  may  give  effect  to  that  authorisation.
- (39) Any  processing  of  biometric  data  and  other  personal  data  involved  in  the  use  of  AI  systems  for  biometric identification,  other  than  in  connection  to the  use  of  real-time  remote  biometric  identification  systems  in publicly accessible  spaces  for  the  purpose  of  law  enforcement  as  regulated  by  this  Regulation,  should  continue  to  comply with  all  requirements  resulting  from  Article  10  of  Directive  (EU)  2016/680.
