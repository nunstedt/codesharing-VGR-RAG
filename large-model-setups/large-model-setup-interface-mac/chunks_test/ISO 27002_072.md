Training should also be given to personnel to ensure that they do not overrule any browser advisory that reports that a website is not secure but allows the user to proceed.
## Other information
Web  filtering  can  include  a  range  of  techniques  including  signatures,  heuristics,  list  of  acceptable websites or domains, list of prohibited websites or domains and bespoke configuration to help prevent malicious software and other malicious activity from attacking the organization's network and systems.

## Control
Rules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, should be defined and implemented.
## Purpose
To  ensure  proper  and  effective  use  of  cryptography  to  protect  the  confidentiality,  authenticity  or integrity of information according to business and information security requirements, and taking into consideration legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements related to cryptography.
## Guidance
## General
When using cryptography, the following should be considered:
- a) the  topic-specific  policy  on  cryptography  defined  by  the  organization,  including  the  general principles for the protection of information. A topic-specific policy on the use of cryptography is necessary to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks of using cryptographic techniques and to avoid inappropriate or incorrect use;
- b) identifying  the  required  level  of  protection  and  the  classification  of  the  information  and consequently establishing the type, strength and quality of the cryptographic algorithms required;
- c) the  use  of  cryptography  for  protection  of  information  held  on  mobile  user  endpoint  devices  or storage media and transmitted over networks to such devices or storage media;
- d) the approach to key management, including methods to deal with the generation and protection of cryptographic keys and the recovery of encrypted information in the case of lost, compromised or damaged keys;
- e) roles and responsibilities for:
- 1) the implementation of the rules for the effective use of cryptography;
- 2) the key management, including key generation (see  );
- f) the standards to be adopted, as well as cryptographic algorithms, cipher strength, cryptographic solutions and usage practices that are approved or required for use in the organization;
- g) the impact of using encrypted information on controls that rely on content inspection (e.g. malware detection or content filtering).
When  implementing  the  organization's  rules  for  effective  use  of  cryptography,  the  regulations and national restrictions that can apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world should be taken into consideration as well as the issues of trans-border flow of encrypted information (see ).
The contents of service level agreements or contracts with external suppliers of cryptographic services (e.g. with a certification authority) should cover issues of liability, reliability of services and response times for the provision of services (see ).
## Key management
Appropriate key management requires secure processes for generating, storing, archiving, retrieving, distributing, retiring and destroying cryptographic keys.
A  key  management  system  should  be  based  on  an  agreed  set  of  standards,  procedures  and  secure methods for:
- a) generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications;
- b) issuing and obtaining public key certificates;
- c) distributing keys to intended entities, including how to activate keys when received;
- d) storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys;
- e) changing or updating keys including rules on when to change keys and how this will be done;
- f) dealing with compromised keys;
- g) revoking keys including how to withdraw or deactivate keys [e.g. when keys have been compromised or when a user leaves an organization (in which case keys should also be archived)];
- h) recovering keys that are lost or corrupted;
- i) backing up or archiving keys;
- j) destroying keys;
- k) logging and auditing of key management related activities;
- l) setting activation and deactivation dates for keys so that the keys can only be used for the period of time according to the organization's rules on key management;
- m)  handling  legal  requests  for  access  to  cryptographic  keys  (e.g.  encrypted  information  can  be required to be made available in an unencrypted form as evidence in a court case).
All cryptographic keys should be protected against modification and loss. In addition, secret and private keys need protection against unauthorized use as well as disclosure. Equipment used to generate, store and archive keys should be physically protected.
In addition to integrity, for many use cases, the authenticity of public keys should also be considered.
## Other information
The  authenticity  of  public  keys  is  usually  addressed  by  public  key  management  processes  using certificate  authorities  and  public  key  certificates,  but  it  is  also  possible  to  address  it  by  using technologies such as applying manual processes for small number keys.
Cryptography can be used to achieve different information security objectives, for example:
- a) confidentiality: using encryption of information to protect sensitive or critical information, either stored or transmitted;
- b) integrity  or  authenticity:  using  digital  signatures  or  message  authentication  codes  to  verify  the authenticity or integrity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information.
