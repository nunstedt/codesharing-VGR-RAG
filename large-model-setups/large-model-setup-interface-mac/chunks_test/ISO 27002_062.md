cloud services) and networks, for newly installed systems as well as for operational systems over their lifetime.
Roles,  responsibilities  and  procedures  should  be  in  place  to  ensure  satisfactory  control  of  all configuration changes.
## Standard templates
Standard  templates  for  the  secure  configuration  of  hardware,  software,  services  and  networks should be defined:
- a) using publicly available guidance (e.g. pre-defined templates from vendors and from independent security organizations);
- b) considering the level of protection needed in order to determine a sufficient level of security;
- c) supporting  the  organization's  information  security  policy,  topic-specific  policies,  standards  and other security requirements;
- d) considering the feasibility and applicability of security configurations in the organization's context.
The templates should be reviewed periodically and updated when new threats or vulnerabilities need to be addressed, or when new software or hardware versions are introduced.
The following should be considered for establishing standard templates for the secure configuration of hardware, software, services and networks:
- a) minimizing the number of identities with privileged or administrator level access rights;
- b) disabling unnecessary, unused or insecure identities;
- c) disabling or restricting unnecessary functions and services;
- d) restricting access to powerful utility programs and host parameter settings;
- e) synchronizing clocks;
- f) changing vendor default authentication information such as default passwords immediately after installation and reviewing other important default security-related parameters;
- g) invoking  time-out  facilities  that  automatically  log  off  computing  devices  after  a  predetermined period of inactivity;
- h) verifying that licence requirements have been met (see ).
## Managing co nfigurations
Established configurations of hardware, software, services and networks should be recorded and a log should be maintained of all configuration changes. These records should be securely stored. This can be achieved in various ways, such as configuration databases or configuration templates.
Changes to configurations should follow the change management process (see ).
Configuration records can contain as relevant:
- a) up-to-date owner or point of contact information for the asset;
- b) date of the last change of configuration;
- c) version of configuration template;
- d) relation to configurations of other assets.
