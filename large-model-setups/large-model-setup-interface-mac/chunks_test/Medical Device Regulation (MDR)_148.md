- 2. The  clinical  evaluation  shall  be  thorough  and  objective,  and  take  into  account  both  favourable  and  unfavourable data.  Its  depth  and  extent  shall  be  proportionate  and  appropriate  to  the  nature,  classification,  intended  purpose and risks of the device in question, as well as to the manufacturer's claims in respect of the device.
- 3. A  clinical  evaluation  may  be  based  on  clinical  data  relating  to  a  device  for  which  equivalence  to  the  device  in question  can  be  demonstrated.  The  following  technical,  biological  and  clinical  characteristics  shall  be  taken  into consideration for  the demonstration of equivalence:
- -  Technical: the device  is  of  similar  design;  is  used  under  similar  conditions  of  use;  has  similar  specifications  and properties  including  physicochemical  properties  such  as  intensity  of  energy,  tensile  strength,  viscosity,  surface characteristics,  wavelength  and  software  algorithms;  uses  similar  deployment  methods,  where  relevant;  has similar  principles of operation and critical performance requirements;
- -  Biological:  the  device  uses  the  same  materials  or  substances  in  contact  with  the  same  human  tissues  or  body fluids  for  a  similar  kind  and  duration  of  contact  and  similar  release  characteristics  of  substances,  including degradation products and leachables; - -  Clinical:  the  device  is  used  for  the  same  clinical  condition  or  purpose,  including  similar  severity  and  stage  of disease, at the same site in the body, in a similar  population, including as regards age, anatomy and physiology; has  the  same  kind  of  user;  has  similar  relevant  critical  performance  in  view  of  the  expected  clinical  effect  for a specific intended purpose.
The  characteristics  listed  in  the  first  paragraph  shall  be  similar  to  the  extent  that  there  would  be  no  clinically significant  difference  in  the  safety  and  clinical  performance  of  the  device.  Considerations  of  equivalence  shall  be based  on  proper  scientific  justification.  It  shall  be  clearly  demonstrated  that  manufacturers  have  sufficient  levels  of access  to  the  data  relating  to  devices  with  which  they  are  claiming  equivalence  in  order  to  justify  their  claims  of equivalence.
- 4. The  results  of  the  clinical  evaluation  and  the  clinical  evidence  on  which  it  is  based  shall  be  documented  in a clinical evaluation report which shall support the assessment of the conformity of the device.
The  clinical  evidence  together  with  non-clinical  data  generated  from  non-clinical  testing  methods  and  other relevant  documentation  shall  allow  the  manufacturer  to  demonstrate  conformity  with  the  general  safety  and performance requirements and shall be part of the technical documentation for the device in question.
Both  favourable  and  unfavourable  data  considered  in  the  clinical  evaluation  shall  be  included  in  the  technical documentation.
## PART B
## POST-MARKET CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP
- 5. PMCF shall be  understood to be a  continuous  process  that  updates  the  clinical  evaluation  referred  to in  Article  61 and  Part  A  of  this  Annex  and  shall  be  addressed  in  the  manufacturer's  post-market  surveillance  plan.  When conducting  PMCF,  the  manufacturer  shall  proactively  collect  and  evaluate  clinical  data  from  the  use  in  or  on humans  of  a  device  which  bears  the  CE  marking  and  is  placed  on  the  market  or  put  into  service  within  its intended  purpose  as  referred  to  in  the  relevant  conformity  assessment  procedure,  with  the  aim  of  confirming  the safety  and  performance  throughout  the  expected  lifetime  of  the  device,  of  ensuring  the  continued  acceptability  of identified risks and of detecting emerging risks on the basis of factual evidence.
- 6. PMCF shall be performed pursuant to a documented method laid down in a PMCF plan.
- .   The  PMCF  plan  shall  specify  the  methods  and  procedures  for  proactively  collecting  and  evaluating  clinical  data with the aim of:
- (a)   confirming the safety and performance of the device throughout its expected lifetime,
- (b)   identifying previously unknown side-effects and monitoring the identified side-effects and contraindications,
- (c)   identifying and analysing emergent risks on the basis of factual evidence,
- (d)   ensuring the continued acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio referred to in Sections 1 and 9 of Annex I, and
- (e)   identifying  possible  systematic  misuse  or  off-label  use  of  the  device,  with  a  view  to  verifying  that  the  intended purpose is correct.
- .   The PMCF plan shall include at least:
- (a)   the  general  methods and procedures of  the PMCF to be applied, such as gathering of clinical experience gained, feedback from users, screening of scientific literature and of other sources of clinical data;
- (b)   the  specific  methods  and  procedures  of  PMCF  to  be  applied,  such  as  evaluation  of  suitable  registers  or  PMCF studies;
- (c)   a  rationale for  the appropriateness of  the methods and procedures referred to in points (a) and (b);
- (d)   a  reference  to  the  relevant  parts  of  the  clinical  evaluation  report  referred  to  in  Section  4  and  to  the  risk management referred to in Section 3 of Annex I;
- (e)   the  specific objectives to be addressed by the PMCF;
- (f)   an evaluation of the clinical data relating to equivalent or similar devices;
- (g)   reference  to  any  relevant  CS,  harmonised  standards  when  used  by  the  manufacturer,  and  relevant  guidance  on PMCF; and
- (h)   a  detailed  and  adequately  justified  time  schedule  for  PMCF  activities  (e.g.  analysis  of  PMCF  data  and  reporting) to be undertaken by the manufacturer.
- 7. The  manufacturer  shall  analyse  the  findings  of  the  PMCF  and  document  the  results  in  a  PMCF  evaluation  report that shall be part of the clinical evaluation report and the technical documentation.
- 8. The conclusions of the PMCF evaluation report shall be taken into account for  the clinical evaluation referred to in Article  61  and  Part  A  of  this  Annex  and  in  the  risk  management  referred  to  in  Section  3  of  Annex  I.  If,  through the PMCF,  the  need  for preventive and/or corrective measures  has  been  identified, the manufacturer  shall implement them. ## ANNEX XV
