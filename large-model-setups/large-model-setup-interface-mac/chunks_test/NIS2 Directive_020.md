## Article 4
## Sector-specific Union legal acts
- 1. Where sector-specific Union legal acts require essential or important entities to adopt cybersecurity risk-management measures or to notify significant incidents and where those requirements are at least equivalent in effect to the obligations laid  down  in  this  Directive,  the  relevant  provisions  of  this  Directive,  including  the  provisions  on  supervision  and enforcement laid down in Chapter VII, shall not apply to such entities. Where sector-specific Union legal acts do not cover all  entities  in  a  specific  sector  falling  within  the  scope  of  this  Directive,  the  relevant  provisions  of  this  Directive  shall continue to apply to the entities not covered by those sector-specific Union legal acts.

- (a) cybersecurity risk-management measures are at least equivalent in effect to those laid down in Article 21(1) and (2); or
- (b) the  sector-specific  Union  legal  act  provides  for  immediate  access,  where  appropriate  automatic  and  direct,  to  the incident notifications by the CSIRTs, the competent authorities or the single points of contact under this Directive and where requirements to notify significant incidents are at least equivalent in effect to those laid down in Article 23(1) to (6) of this Directive.
