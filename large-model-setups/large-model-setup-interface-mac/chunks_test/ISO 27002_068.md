Where practical, segregating network communications for such programs from application traffic;
- h) limitation of the availability of utility programs (e.g. for the duration of an authorized change);
- i) logging of all use of utility programs.
## Other information
Most information systems have one or more utility programs that can be capable of overriding system and application controls, for example diagnostics, patching, antivirus, disk defragmenters, debuggers, backup and network tools.

## Control
Procedures  and  measures  should  be  implemented  to  securely  manage  software  installation  on operational systems.
## Purpose
To ensure the integrity of operational systems and prevent exploitation of technical vulnerabilities.
## Guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to securely manage changes and installation of software on operational systems:
- a) performing  updates  of  operational  software  only  by  trained  administrators  upon  appropriate management authorization (see  );
- b) ensuring that only approved executable code and no development code or compilers is installed on operational systems;
- c) only installing and updating software after extensive and successful testing (see  and  );
- d) updating all corresponding program source libraries;
- e) using  a  configuration  control  system  to  keep  control  of  all  operational  software  as  well  as  the system documentation;
- f) defining a rollback strategy before changes are implemented;
- g) maintaining an audit log of all updates to operational software;
- h) archiving  old  versions  of  software,  together  with  all  required  information  and  parameters, procedures, configuration details and supporting software as a contingency measure, and for as long as the software is required to read or process archived data.
Any decision to upgrade to a new release should take into account the business requirements for the change and the security of the release (e.g. the introduction of new information security functionality or the number and severity of information security vulnerabilities affecting the current version). Software patches should be applied when they can help to remove or reduce information security vulnerabilities (see  and ).
Computer software can rely on externally supplied software and packages (e.g. software programs using modules which are hosted on external sites), which should be monitored and controlled to avoid unauthorized changes, because they can introduce information security vulnerabilities.
