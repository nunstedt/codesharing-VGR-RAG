Where the market surveillance authority considers that the non-compliance is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States without undue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the actions  which it  has  required  the  operator  to  take.
- 4. The operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the AI systems concerned that it  has  made  available  on  the  Union  market.
- 5. Where  the  operator  of  an  AI  system  does  not  take  adequate  corrective  action  within  the  period  referred  to  in paragraph 2, the market surveillance authority shall take all appropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the AI system's  being  made  available  on  its  national  market  or  put  into  service,  to  withdraw  the  product  or  the  standalone  AI system  from  that  market  or  to  recall  it.  That  authority  shall  without  undue  delay  notify  the  Commission  and  the  other Member States of  those  measures.
- 6. The notification referred to in paragraph 5 shall include all available details, in particular  the information necessary for  the  identification  of  the non-compliant AI system, the origin of  the AI system and the supply chain, the nature of  the non-compliance alleged and the risk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put  forward  by  the  relevant  operator.  In  particular,  the  market  surveillance  authorities  shall  indicate  whether the non-compliance is due to one or  more of  the  following:
- (a) non-compliance with the prohibition of  the AI  practices  referred  to  in  Article  5;
- (b) a  failure  of  a  high-risk  AI  system  to  meet  requirements  set  out  in  Chapter  III,  Section  2;
- (c) shortcomings  in  the  harmonised  standards  or  common  specifications  referred  to  in  Articles  40  and  41  conferring a  presumption of  conformity;
- (d) non-compliance with Article 50.
- 7. The market surveillance  authorities  other  than  the  market  surveillance  authority of  the  Member  State  initiating  the procedure shall, without undue delay, inform the Commission and the other Member States of any measures adopted and of any additional information at their disposal relating to the non-compliance of the AI system concerned, and, in the event of disagreement  with  the  notified  national  measure,  of  their  objections.
- 8. Where, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, no objection has been raised by either a market surveillance authority of a Member State or by the Commission in respect of a provisional measure  taken  by  a  market  surveillance  authority  of  another  Member  State,  that  measure  shall  be  deemed  justified.  This shall be without prejudice to the procedural rights of the concerned operator in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU)  2019/1020.  The  three-month  period  referred  to  in  this  paragraph  shall  be  reduced  to  30  days  in  the  event  of non-compliance with the prohibition of  the AI  practices  referred  to  in  Article  5  of  this  Regulation.
- 9. The  market  surveillance  authorities  shall  ensure  that  appropriate  restrictive  measures  are  taken  in  respect  of  the product or the AI system concerned, such as withdrawal of the product or the AI system from their market, without undue delay.
Article  80
## Procedure for dealing with AI systems classified by the provider as non-high-risk in application of Annex III
- 1. Where a market surveillance authority has sufficient reason to consider that an AI system classified by the provider as non-high-risk pursuant to Article 6(3) is indeed high-risk, the market surveillance authority shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its classification as a high-risk AI system based on the conditions set out in Article 6(3)  and  the  Commission  guidelines.
- 2. Where,  in  the  course  of  that  evaluation,  the  market  surveillance  authority  finds  that  the  AI  system  concerned  is high-risk, it shall without undue delay require the relevant provider to take all necessary actions to bring the AI system into compliance with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, as well as take appropriate corrective action within  a  period  the  market  surveillance  authority  may  prescribe.
- 3. Where  the  market  surveillance  authority  considers  that  the  use  of  the  AI  system  concerned  is  not  restricted  to  its national territory, it  shall  inform the  Commission and the other Member States without undue delay of  the results of  the evaluation  and  of  the  actions  which  it  has  required  the  provider  to  take.
- 4. The  provider  shall  ensure  that  all  necessary  action  is  taken  to  bring  the  AI  system  into  compliance  with  the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Where the provider of an AI system concerned does not bring the AI system into compliance with those requirements and obligations within the period referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article,  the  provider  shall  be  subject  to  fines  in  accordance  with  Article  99.
- 5. The provider shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the AI systems concerned that it  has  made  available  on  the  Union  market.
- 6. Where the provider of the AI system concerned does not take adequate corrective action within the period referred to in  paragraph  2  of  this  Article,  Article  79(5)  to  (9)  shall  apply.
- 7. Where,  in  the  course  of  the  evaluation  pursuant  to  paragraph  1  of  this  Article,  the  market  surveillance  authority establishes that the AI system was misclassified by the provider as non-high-risk in order to circumvent the application of requirements  in  Chapter  III,  Section  2,  the  provider  shall  be  subject  to  fines  in  accordance  with  Article  99.
- 8. In exercising their power to monitor the application of this Article, and in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU)  2019/1020,  market  surveillance  authorities  may  perform  appropriate  checks,  taking  into  account  in  particular information stored in the  EU  database  referred  to  in  Article  71  of  this  Regulation.
## Article  81
## Union safeguard procedure
- 1. Where, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 79(5), or within 30 days in the case of non-compliance  with  the  prohibition  of  the  AI  practices  referred  to  in  Article  5,  objections  are  raised  by  the  market surveillance  authority  of  a  Member  State  to  a  measure  taken  by  another  market  surveillance  authority,  or  where  the Commission  considers  the  measure  to  be  contrary  to  Union  law,  the  Commission  shall  without  undue  delay  enter  into consultation with the market surveillance authority of the relevant Member State and the operator or operators, and shall evaluate the national measure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall, within six months, or within 60 days in the case of non-compliance with the prohibition of the AI practices referred to in Article 5, starting from the notification referred to in Article 79(5), decide whether the national measure is justified and shall notify its decision to the  market  surveillance  authority  of  the  Member  State  concerned.  The  Commission  shall  also  inform  all  other  market surveillance  authorities  of  its  decision.
- 2. Where the Commission considers the measure taken by the relevant Member State to be justified, all Member States shall  ensure  that  they  take  appropriate  restrictive  measures  in  respect  of  the  AI  system  concerned,  such  as  requiring  the withdrawal of the AI system from their market without undue delay, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. Where the Commission considers the national measure to be unjustified, the Member State concerned shall withdraw the measure and shall  inform  the  Commission  accordingly.
- 3. Where  the  national  measure  is  considered  justified  and  the  non-compliance  of  the  AI  system  is  attributed  to shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications referred to in Articles 40 and 41 of this Regulation, the  Commission shall  apply  the  procedure  provided  for  in  Article  11  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1025/2012.
## Article  82
## Compliant AI systems which present a risk
- 1. Where,  having  performed  an  evaluation  under  Article  79,  after  consulting  the  relevant  national  public  authority referred to in Article 77(1), the market surveillance authority of a Member State finds that although a high-risk AI system complies with this Regulation, it nevertheless presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, to fundamental rights, or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall require the relevant operator  to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the AI system concerned, when placed on the market or put into service, no longer presents that risk without undue delay,  within  a  period  it  may  prescribe.
- 2. The  provider  or  other  relevant  operator  shall  ensure  that  corrective  action  is  taken  in  respect  of  all  the  AI  systems concerned  that  it  has  made  available  on  the  Union  market  within  the  timeline  prescribed  by  the  market  surveillance authority of  the  Member  State  referred  to  in  paragraph  1.
- 3. The  Member  States  shall  immediately  inform  the  Commission  and  the  other  Member  States  of  a  finding  under paragraph 1. That information shall include all available details, in particular the data necessary for the identification of the AI system concerned, the origin and the supply chain of the AI system, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and duration  of  the  national  measures  taken.
