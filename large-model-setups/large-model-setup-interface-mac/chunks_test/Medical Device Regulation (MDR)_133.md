- -  risk management as referred to in Section 3 of Annex I,
- -  the clinical evaluation, pursuant to Article 61 and Annex XIV, including post-market clinical follow-up,
- -  solutions  for  fulfilling  the  applicable  specific  requirements  regarding  design  and  construction,  including appropriate pre-clinical evaluation, in particular  the requirements of Chapter II of Annex I,
- -  solutions  for  fulfilling  the  applicable  specific  requirements  regarding  the  information  to  be  supplied  with the device, in particular  the requirements of Chapter III of Annex I,
- -  the device identification procedures drawn  up and  kept up to date from  drawings,  specifications  or  other relevant documents at every stage of manufacture, and
- -  management of design or quality management system changes; and
- (d)   the  verification  and  quality  assurance  techniques  at  the  manufacturing  stage  and  in  particular  the  processes and procedures which are to be used, particularly as regards sterilisation and the relevant documents; and
- (e)   the  appropriate  tests  and  trials  which  are  to  be  carried  out  before,  during  and  after  manufacture,  the frequency  with  which  they  are  to  take  place,  and  the  test  equipment  to  be  used;  it  shall  be  possible  to  trace back adequately the calibration of that test equipment.
In  addition,  the  manufacturer  shall  grant  the  notified  body  access  to  the  technical  documentation  referred  to  in Annexes II and III.
## . Audit
The  notified  body  shall  audit  the  quality  management  system  to  determine  whether  it  meets  the  requirements referred  to  in  Section  .  Where  the  manufacturer  uses  a  harmonised  standard  or  CS  related  to  a  quality management  system,  the  notified  body  shall  assess  conformity  with  those  standards  or  CS.  The  notified  body shall  assume  that  a  quality  management  system  which  satisfies  the  relevant  harmonised  standards  or  CS conforms to the requirements covered by those standards or CS, unless it duly substantiates not doing so.
