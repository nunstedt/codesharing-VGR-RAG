 ## DIRECTIVE (EU) 2022/2557 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 2022
## on the resilience of critical entities and repealing Council Directive 2008/114/EC
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions ( 2 ),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 3 ),
Whereas:
- (1) Critical  entities,  as  providers  of  essential  services,  play  an  indispensable  role  in  the  maintenance  of  vital  societal functions  or  economic  activities  in  the  internal  market  in  an  increasingly  interdependent  Union  economy.  It  is therefore essential to set out a Union framework with the aim of both enhancing the resilience of critical entities in the  internal  market  by  laying  down  harmonised  minimum  rules  and  assisting  them  by  means  of  coherent  and dedicated support and supervision measures.
- (2) Council Directive 2008/114/EC ( 4 ) provides for a procedure for designating European critical infrastructure in the energy and transport sectors the disruption or destruction of which would have a significant cross-border  impact on at least two Member States. That Directive focuses exclusively on the protection of such infrastructure. However, the evaluation of Directive 2008/114/EC conducted in 2019 found that, due to the increasingly interconnected and cross-border nature of operations using critical infrastructure, protective measures relating to individual assets alone are insufficient to prevent all disruptions from taking place. Therefore, it is necessary to shift the approach towards ensuring  that  risks  are  better  accounted  for,  that  the  role  and  duties  of  critical  entities  as  providers  of  services essential to the functioning of the internal market are better defined and coherent, and that Union rules are adopted
