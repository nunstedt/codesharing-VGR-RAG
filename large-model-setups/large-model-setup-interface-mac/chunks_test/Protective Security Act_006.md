## Section 8
Before a process referred to in Section 1 is initiated, the operator must, through a specific protective security assessment, identify any classified information or other security-sensitive activities that the other actor may access and that require protective security.
Based on the specific protective security assessment and other circumstances, the operator must examine whether the planned process is appropriate from a protective security standpoint.
The specific protective security assessment and suitability examination must be documented.
If the suitability examination leads to the assessment that the planned process is inappropriate from a protective security standpoint, it must not be initiated. Act 2021:952.
## Section 9
If the suitability examination under Section 8 leads to the assessment that the planned process is not inappropriate from a protective security standpoint, before the process is initiated the operator must consult with the supervisory authority if the planned process means that the other actor may access:
- 1. information that is classified as secret or higher; or
- 2. other security-sensitive activities of corresponding significance to Sweden's security.
The supervisory authority may decide to impose injunctions on the operator to take measures under this Act and regulations issued in connection with it. Act 2021:952.
## Section 10
If the operator does not consult with the supervisory authority despite being obliged to do so, the authority may initiate such consultation. Act 2021:952.
## Section 11
If a decision to impose injunctions under Section 9 is not complied with or if the planned process is inappropriate from a protective security standpoint even if additional measures are taken, the supervisory authority may decide that the planned process must not be undertaken (prohibition). Act 2021:952.
## Section 12
If an ongoing process covered by a protective security agreement requirement under Section 1 is inappropriate from a protective security standpoint, the supervisory authority may impose any injunctions on the operator and the other actor in the process that are necessary to prevent damage to Sweden's security. A decision to impose injunctions may be combined with a penalty of a fine. Act 2021:952.
