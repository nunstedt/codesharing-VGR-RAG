That  assessment  shall  include  examination  of  the  implementation by manufacturers of  incoming, inprocess  and  final  checks  and  the  results  thereof.  If  further tests  or  other  evidence  is  required  for the assessment  of  conformity  with  the  requirements  of  this  Regulation,  the  notified  body  in  question  shall  carry out  adequate  physical  or  laboratory  tests  in  relation  to  the  device  or  request  the  manufacturer  to  carry  out such tests.
## Type-examinations
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures,  sufficient  expertise  and  facilities  for  the  type-examination of devices in accordance with Annex X including the capacity to:
- -  examine  and  assess  the  technical  documentation  taking  account  of  Sections  .  to  .,  and  verify  that the type has been manufactured in conformity with that documentation;
- -  establish  a  test  plan  identifying  all  relevant  and  critical  parameters  which  need  to  be  tested  by  the  notified body or under its responsibility;
- -  document its rationale for  the selection of those parameters;
- -  carry  out  the  appropriate  examinations  and  tests  in  order  to  verify  that  the  solutions  adopted  by  the manufacturer  meet  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  set  out  in  Annex  I.  Such  examinations and  tests  shall  include  all  tests  necessary  to  verify  that  the  manufacturer  has  in  fact  applied  the  relevant standards it has opted to use;
- -  agree  with  the  applicant  as  to  where  the  necessary  tests  will  be  performed  if  they  are  not  to  be  carried  out directly by the notified body; and
- -  assume full responsibility  for  test  results.  Test  reports  submitted  by  the  manufacturer  shall  only  be  taken  into account  if  they  have  been  issued  by  conformity  assessment  bodies  which  are  competent  and  independent  of the manufacturer.
Verification by examination and testing of every product
The notified body shall:
- (a)   have  documented  procedures,  sufficient  expertise  and  facilities  for  the  verification  by examination  and  testing of every product in accordance with Part B of Annex XI;
- (b)   establish  a  test  plan  identifying  all  relevant  and  critical  parameters  which  need  to  be  tested  by  the  notified body or under its responsibility in order  to:
- - verify,  for  class  IIb  devices,  the  conformity  of  the  device  with  the  type  described  in  the  EU  type-exami­ nation certificate and with the requirements of this Regulation which apply to those devices,
- -  confirm,  for  class  IIa  devices,  the  conformity  with  the  technical  documentation  referred  to  in  Annexes  II and III and with the requirements of this Regulation which apply to those devices;
- (c)   document its rationale for  the selection of  the parameters referred to in point (b);
- (d)   have  documented  procedures  to  carry  out  the  appropriate  assessments  and  tests  in  order  to  verify  the conformity of  the  device  with  the  requirements  of  this  Regulation  by examining  and  testing  every  product  as specified in Section 15 of Annex XI;
- (e)   have  documented procedures providing for  the reaching of an agreement with the applicant concerning when and where necessary tests that are not to be carried out by the notified body itself are to be performed; and
- (f)   assume  full  responsibility  for  test  results  in  accordance  with  documented  procedures;  test  reports  submitted by  the  manufacturer  shall  only  be  taken  into  account  if  they  have  been  issued  by  conformity  assessment bodies which are competent and independent of the manufacturer.
## .   Pre-clinical evaluation assessment
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  in  place  for  the  review  of  the  manufacturer's  procedures and documentation relating to the evaluation of pre-clinical aspects. The notified body shall examine, validate and verify that the manufacturer's procedures and documentation adequately address:
- (a)   the  planning,  conduct,  assessment,  reporting  and,  where  appropriate,  updating  of  the  pre-clinical  evaluation, in particular of
- -  the scientific pre-clinical literature search, and
- -  the pre-clinical  testing,  for  example  laboratory  testing,  simulated  use  testing,  computer  modelling,  the  use of animal models,
- (b)   the  nature and duration of body contact and the specific associated biological risks,
- (c)   the  interface with the risk management process, and
- (d)   the  appraisal  and  analysis  of  the  available  pre-clinical  data  and  its  relevance  with  regard  to  demonstrating conformity with the relevant requirements in Annex I.
The  notified  body's  assessment  of  pre-clinical  evaluation  procedures  and  documentation  shall  address  the  results of  literature  searches  and  all  validation,  verification  and  testing  performed  and  conclusions  drawn,  and  shall typically  include  considering  the  use  of  alternative  materials  and  substances  and  take  account  of  the  packaging, stability,  including shelf  life, of  the finished device. Where no new testing has been undertaken by a manufacturer or  where  there  are  deviations  from  procedures,  the  notified  body  in  question  shall  critically  examine  the  justifi­ cation presented by the manufacturer.
## .   Clinical evaluation assessment
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  in  place  relating  to  the  assessment  of  a  manufacturer's procedures  and  documentation  relating  to  clinical  evaluation  both  for  initial  conformity  assessment  and  on  an ongoing basis. The notified body shall examine, validate and verify that manufacturers' procedures and documen­ tation adequately address:
- -  the  planning,  conduct,  assessment,  reporting  and  updating  of the clinical  evaluation as referred to in Annex XIV,
- -  post-market surveillance and PMCF,
- -  the interface with the risk management process,
- -  the  appraisal  and  analysis  of  the  available  data  and  its  relevance  with  regard  to  demonstrating  conformity with the relevant requirements in Annex I, and
- -  the conclusions drawn with regard to the clinical evidence and drawing up of the clinical evaluation report.
These  procedures  referred  to  in  the  first  paragraph  shall  take  into  consideration  available  CS,  guidance  and  best practice documents.
The notified body's assessment of clinical evaluations as referred to in Annex XIV shall cover:
- -  the intended use specified by the manufacturer and claims for the device defined by it,
- -  the planning of the clinical evaluation,
- -  the methodology for the literature search,
- -  relevant documentation from the literature search,
- -  the clinical investigation,
- -  validity  of  equivalence  claimed  in  relation  to  other  devices,  the  demonstration  of  equivalence,  the  suitability and conclusions data from equivalent and similar devices,
- -  post-market surveillance and PMCF,
- -  the clinical evaluation report, and
- -  justifications in relation to non-performance of clinical investigations or PMCF.
In  relation  to  clinical  data  from  clinical  investigations  included  within  the  clinical  evaluation,  the  notified  body  in question  shall  ensure  that  the  conclusions  drawn  by  the  manufacturer  are  valid  in  the  light  of  the  approved clinical investigation plan.
The notified body shall ensure that the clinical evaluation adequately addresses the relevant safety and performance  requirements  provided  for  in  Annex  I,  that  it  is  appropriately  aligned  with  the  risk  management requirements,  that  it  is  conducted  in  accordance  with  Annex  XIV  and  that  it  is  appropriately  reflected  in  the information provided relating to the device.
## .   Specific Procedures
The notified body shall have documented procedures, sufficient expertise and facilities for  the procedures referred to  in  Sections  5  and  6  of  Annex  IX,  Section  6  of  Annex  X  and  Section  16  of  Annex  XI,  for  which  they  are designated.
