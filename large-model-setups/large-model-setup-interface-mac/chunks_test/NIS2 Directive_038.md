Where enforcement measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 4, points (a) to (d) and (f), are ineffective, Member States shall  ensure  that  their  competent  authorities  have  the  power  to  establish  a  deadline  by  which  the  essential  entity  is requested to take the necessary action to remedy the deficiencies or to comply with the requirements of those authorities.
