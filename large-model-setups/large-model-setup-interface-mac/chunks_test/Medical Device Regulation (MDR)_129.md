- . Software, which drives a device or influences the use of a device, shall fall within the same class as the device.
- If  the  software is independent of any other device, it shall be classified in its own right.
- . If  the  device  is  not  intended  to  be  used  solely  or  principally  in  a  specific  part  of  the  body,  it  shall  be  considered and classified on the basis of the most critical specified use.
- . If  several  rules,  or  if,  within  the  same  rule,  several  sub-rules,  apply  to  the  same  device  based  on  the  device's intended purpose, the strictest rule and sub-rule resulting in the higher classification shall apply.
- . In calculating the duration referred to in Section 1, continuous use shall mean:
- (a)   the  entire  duration  of  use  of  the  same  device  without  regard  to  temporary  interruption  of  use  during a  procedure  or  temporary  removal  for  purposes  such  as  cleaning  or  disinfection  of  the  device.  Whether  the interruption  of  use  or  the  removal  is  temporary  shall  be  established  in  relation  to  the  duration  of  the  use prior  to and after  the period when the use is interrupted or  the device removed; and
- (b)   the  accumulated use of a device that is intended by the manufacturer  to be replaced immediately with another of  the same type.
- . A  device  is  considered  to  allow  direct  diagnosis  when  it  provides  the  diagnosis  of  the  disease  or  condition  in question by itself or  when it provides decisive information for  the diagnosis.
## CHAPTER III
## CLASSIFICATION RULES
- 4. NON-INVASIVE DEVICES
## . Rule 1
All non-invasive devices are classified as class I, unless one of the rules set out hereinafter applies.
## . Rule 2
All  non-invasive  devices  intended  for  channelling  or  storing  blood,  body  liquids,  cells  or  tissues,  liquids  or  gases for  the purpose of eventual infusion, administration or introduction into the body are classified as class IIa:
- -  if  they may be connected to a class IIa, class IIb or class III active device; or
- -  if  they  are  intended  for  use  for  channelling  or  storing  blood  or  other  body  liquids  or  for  storing  organs,  parts of organs or body cells and tissues, except for blood bags; blood bags are classified as class IIb.
In all other cases, such devices are classified as class I.
## . Rule 3
All  non-invasive devices intended for  modifying the biological or chemical composition of human tissues or cells, blood, other body liquids or other liquids intended for  implantation or administration into the body are classified as  class  IIb,  unless  the  treatment  for  which  the  device  is  used  consists  of  filtration,  centrifugation  or  exchanges  of gas, heat, in which case they are classified as class IIa.
All  non-invasive devices consisting of a substance or a mixture of substances intended to be used in  vitro in  direct contact  with  human  cells,  tissues  or  organs  taken  from  the  human  body  or  used in  vitro with  human  embryos before their  implantation or administration into the body are classified as class III.
## . Rule 4
All non-invasive devices which come into contact with injured skin or mucous membrane are classified as:
- -  class I if  they are intended to be used as a mechanical barrier, for compression or for absorption of exudates;
- -  class  IIb  if  they  are  intended  to  be  used  principally  for  injuries  to  skin  which  have  breached  the  dermis  or mucous membrane and can only heal by secondary intent; - -  class  IIa  if  they  are  principally  intended  to  manage  the  micro-environment  of  injured  skin  or  mucous membrane; and
- -  class IIa in all other cases.
This rule applies also to the invasive devices that come into contact with injured mucous membrane.
