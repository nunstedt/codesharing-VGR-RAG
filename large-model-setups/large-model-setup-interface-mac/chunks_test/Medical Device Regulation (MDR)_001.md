REGULATION (EU) 2017/745 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 5 April 2017
on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 and Article 168(4)(c) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After  transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure  ( 2 ),
## Whereas:
- (1) Council Directive 90/385/EEC ( 3 )  and  Council  Directive  93/42/EEC  ( 4 )  constitute  the  Union  regulatory  framework for  medical  devices,  other  than in  vitro diagnostic  medical  devices.  However,  a  fundamental  revision  of  those Directives  is  needed  to  establish  a  robust,  transparent,  predictable  and  sustainable  regulatory  framework  for medical devices which ensures a high level of safety and health whilst supporting innovation.
- (2) This  Regulation  aims  to  ensure  the  smooth  functioning  of  the  internal  market  as  regards  medical  devices,  taking as  a  base  a  high  level  of  protection  of  health  for  patients  and  users,  and  taking  into  account  the  small-  and medium-sized  enterprises  that  are  active  in  this  sector.  At  the  same  time,  this  Regulation  sets  high  standards  of quality  and  safety  for  medical  devices  in  order  to  meet  common  safety  concerns  as  regards  such  products.  Both objectives  are  being  pursued  simultaneously  and  are  inseparably  linked  whilst  one  not  being  secondary  to  the other.  As  regards  Article  114  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union  (TFEU),  this  Regulation harmonises  the  rules  for  the  placing  on  the  market  and  putting  into  service  of  medical  devices  and  their accessories  on  the  Union  market  thus  allowing  them  to  benefit  from  the  principle  of  free  movement  of  goods.
