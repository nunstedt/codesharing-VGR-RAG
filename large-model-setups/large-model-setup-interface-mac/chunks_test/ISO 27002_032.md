## Guidance
The organization should establish and communicate topic-specific policy on the use of cloud services to all relevant interested parties.
The organization should define and communicate how it intends to manage information security risks associated with the use of cloud services. It can be an extension or part of the existing approach for how an organization manages services provided by external parties (see  and ).
The use of cloud services can involve shared responsibility for information security and collaborative effort between the cloud service provider and the organization acting as the cloud service customer. It is essential that the responsibilities for both the cloud service provider and the organization, acting as the cloud service customer, are defined and implemented appropriately.
The organization should define:
- a) all relevant information security requirements associated with the use of the cloud services;
- b) cloud service selection criteria and scope of cloud service usage;
- c) roles and responsibilities related to the use and management of cloud services;
- d) which  information  security  controls  are  managed  by  the  cloud  service  provider  and  which  are managed by the organization as the cloud service customer;
- e) how to obtain and utilize information security capabilities provided by the cloud service provider;
- f) how to obtain assurance on information security controls implemented by cloud service providers;
- g) how to manage controls, interfaces and changes in services when an organization uses multiple cloud services, particularly from different cloud service providers;
- h) procedures  for  handling  information  security  incidents  that  occur  in  relation  to  the  use  of cloud services;
- i) its approach for monitoring, reviewing and evaluating the ongoing use of cloud services to manage information security risks;
- j) how to change or stop the use of cloud services including exit strategies for cloud services.
Cloud service agreements are often pre-defined and not open to negotiation. For all cloud services, the organization should review cloud service agreements with the cloud service provider(s). A cloud service agreement should address the confidentiality, integrity, availability and information handling requirements of  the  organization,  with  appropriate  cloud  service  level  objectives  and  cloud  service qualitative objectives. The organization should also undertake relevant risk assessments to identify the risks associated with using the cloud service. Any residual risks connected to the use of the cloud service should be clearly identified and accepted by the appropriate management of the organization.
An agreement between the cloud service provider and the organization, acting as the cloud service customer,  should  include  the  following  provisions  for  the  protection  of  the  organization's  data  and availability of services:
- a) providing solutions based on industry accepted standards for architecture and infrastructure;
- b) managing access controls of the cloud service to meet the requirements of the organization;
- c) implementing malware monitoring and protection solutions;
- d) processing  and  storing  the  organization's  sensitive  information  in  approved  locations  (e.g. particular country or region) or within or subject to a particular jurisdiction;
- e) providing dedicated support in the event of an information security incident in the cloud service environment;
- f) ensuring that the organization's information security requirements are met in the event of cloud services being further sub-contracted to an external supplier (or prohibiting cloud services from being sub-contracted);
- g) supporting  the  organization  in  gathering  digital  evidence,  taking  into  consideration  laws  and regulations for digital evidence across different jurisdictions;
- h) providing appropriate support and availability of services for an appropriate time frame when the organization wants to exit from the cloud service;
- i) providing required backup of data and configuration information and securely managing backups as  applicable,  based  on  the  capabilities  of  the  cloud  service  provider  used  by  the  organization, acting as the cloud service customer;
- j) providing  and  returning  information  such  as  configuration  files,  source  code  and  data  that  are owned  by  the  organization,  acting  as  the  cloud  service  customer,  when  requested  during  the service provision or at termination of service.
The organization, acting as the cloud service customer, should consider whether the agreement should require  cloud  service  providers  to  provide  advance  notification  prior  to  any  substantive  customer impacting changes being made to the way the service is delivered to the organization, including:
- a) changes to the technical infrastructure (e.g. relocation, reconfiguration, or changes in hardware or software) that affect or change the cloud service offering;
- b) processing or storing information in a new geographical or legal jurisdiction;
- c) use of peer cloud service providers or other sub-contractors (including changing existing or using new parties).
The organization using cloud services should maintain close contact with its cloud service providers. These contacts enable mutual exchange of information about information security for the use of the cloud services including a mechanism for both cloud service provider and the organization, acting as the cloud service customer, to monitor each service characteristic and report failures to the commitments contained in the agreements.
