- (93) The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to the  extension  to  the  territory  of  the  Union  of  a  national  derogation  from  the  applicable  conformity  assessment procedures, imperative grounds of urgency so require.

However,  certain  parts  of  the  Regulation  that  directly  affect  Member  States  and  the  Commission  should  be implemented  as  soon  as  possible.
