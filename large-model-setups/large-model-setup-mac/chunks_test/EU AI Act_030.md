A  balanced  representation  of  interests  involving  all  relevant  stakeholders  in  the  development  of  standards,  in particular  SMEs,  consumer organisations and environmental and social stakeholders in accordance with Articles 5 and  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1025/2012  should  therefore  be  encouraged.  In  order  to  facilitate  compliance,  the standardisation requests should be issued by the Commission  without  undue  delay. When  preparing  the standardisation  request,  the  Commission  should  consult  the  advisory  forum  and  the  Board  in  order  to  collect relevant expertise. However, in the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the Commission should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after consultation of the advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements under this Regulation.
