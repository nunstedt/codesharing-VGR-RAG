The  notified  body  may  request  other samples as necessary, and
- -  a  written  declaration  that  no  application  has  been  lodged  with  any  other  notified  body  for  the  same  type,  or information about any previous application for  the same type that was refused by another notified body or  was withdrawn  by  the  manufacturer  or  its  authorised  representative  before  that  other  notified  body  made  its  final assessment.
## 3. Assessment
The notified body shall:
- (a)   examine  the  application  by  using  staff  with  proven  knowledge  and  experience  regarding  the  technology concerned and its clinical application. The notified body may require the application to be completed by having further  tests  carried  out  or  requesting  further  evidence  to  be  provided  to  allow  assessment  of  conformity  with the  relevant  requirements  of  this  Regulation.  The  notified  body  shall  carry  out  adequate  physical  or  laboratory tests in relation to the device or  request the manufacturer  to carry out such tests;
- (b)   examine  and  assess  the  technical  documentation  for  conformity  with  the  requirements  of  this  Regulation  that are  applicable  to  the  device  and  verify  that  the  type  has  been  manufactured  in  conformity  with  that  documenÂ­ tation;  it  shall  also  record  the  items  designed  in  conformity  with  the  applicable  standards  referred  to  in Article  8  or  with  applicable  CS,  and  record  the  items  not  designed  on  the  basis  of  the  relevant  standards referred to in Article 8 or of the relevant CS;
- (c)   review  the  clinical  evidence  presented  by  the  manufacturer  in  the  clinical  evaluation  report  in  accordance  with Section  4  of  Annex  XIV.  The  notified  body  shall  employ  device  reviewers  with  sufficient  clinical  expertise  and, if  necessary, use external  clinical experts with direct and current experience relating to the device in question or to the clinical condition in which it is utilised, for  the purposes of that review;
- (d)   in  circumstances  in  which  the  clinical  evidence  is  based  partly  or  totally  on  data  from  devices  which  are claimed  to  be  similar  or  equivalent  to  the  device  under  assessment,  assess  the  suitability  of  using  such  data, taking  into  account  factors  such  as  new  indications  and  innovation.  The  notified  body  shall  clearly  document its  conclusions  on  the  claimed  equivalence,  and  on  the  relevance  and  adequacy  of  the  data  for  demonstrating conformity;
- (e)   clearly  document  the  outcome  of  its  assessment  in  a  pre-clinical  and  clinical  evaluation  assessment  report  as part of  the EU type examination report referred to in point (i);
- (f)   carry  out  or  arrange  for  the  appropriate  assessments  and  the  physical  or  laboratory  tests  necessary  to  verify whether  the  solutions  adopted  by  the  manufacturer  meet  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  laid down  in  this  Regulation,  in  the  event  that  the  standards  referred  to  in  Article  8  or  the  CS  have  not  been applied.  Where  the  device  has  to  be  connected  to  another  device  or  devices  in  order  to  operate  as  intended, proof  shall  be  provided  that  it  conforms  to  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  when  connected to any such device or devices having the characteristics specified by the manufacturer;
- (g)   carry  out  or  arrange  for  the  appropriate  assessments  and  the  physical  or  laboratory  tests  necessary  to  verify whether,  in  the  event  that  the  manufacturer  has  chosen  to  apply  the  relevant  harmonised  standards,  those standards have actually been applied;
- (h)   agree with the applicant on the place where the necessary assessments and tests are to be carried out; and
- (i)   draw up an EU type-examination report on the results of  the assessments and tests carried out under  points (a) to (g).
## 4. Certificate
- If  the  type  conforms  to  this  Regulation,  the  notified  body  shall  issue  an  EU  type-examination  certificate.  The certificate  shall  contain  the  name  and  address  of  the  manufacturer,  the  conclusions  of  the  type  examination assessment,  the  conditions  of  the  certificate's  validity  and  the  data  needed  for  identification  of  the  type  approved. The  certificate  shall  be  drawn  up  in  accordance  with  Annex  XII.  The  relevant  parts  of  the  documentation  shall  be annexed to the certificate and a copy kept by the notified body.
## 5. Changes to the type
- .   The  applicant  shall  inform  the  notified  body  which  issued  the  EU  type-examination  certificate  of  any  planned change to the approved type or of its intended purpose and conditions of use.
- .   Changes  to  the  approved  device  including  limitations  of  its  intended  purpose  and  conditions  of  use  shall  require approval  from  the  notified  body  which  issued  the  EU  type-examination  certificate  where  such  changes  may  affect conformity  with  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  or  with  the  conditions  prescribed  for  use  of  the product.  The  notified  body  shall  examine  the  planned  changes,  notify  the  manufacturer  of  its  decision  and  provide him with a supplement to the EU type-examination report. The approval of any change to the approved type shall take the form of a supplement to the EU type-examination certificate.
- .   Changes to the intended purpose and conditions of use of the approved device, with the exception of  limitations of the intended purpose and conditions of use, shall necessitate a new application for a conformity assessment.
- 6. Specific additional procedures
- Section  5  of  Annex  IX  shall  apply  with  the  proviso  that  any  reference  to  an  EU  technical  documentation assessment certificate shall be understood as a reference to an EU type-examination certificate.
## 7. Administrative provisions
The  manufacturer  or,  where  the  manufacturer  does  not  have  a  registered  place  of  business  in  a  Member  State,  its authorised representative shall, for a period ending no sooner  than 10 years, and in the case of implantable devices no sooner than 15 years, after the last device has been placed on the market, keep at the disposal of the competent authorities:
- -  the documentation referred to in the second indent of Section 2,
- -  information on the changes referred to in Section 5, and
- -  copies of EU type-examination certificates, scientific opinions and reports and their additions/supplements.
Section 8 of Annex IX shall apply. ## ANNEX XI
## CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT BASED ON PRODUCT CONFORMITY VERIFICATION
- 1. The  objective  of  the  conformity  assessment  based  on  product  conformity  verification  is  to  ensure  that  devices conform  to  the  type  for  which  an  EU  type-examination  certificate  has  been  issued,  and  that  they  meet  the provisions of this Regulation which apply to them.
- 2. Where  an  EU  type-examination  certificate  has  been  issued  in  accordance  with  Annex  X,  the  manufacturer  may either  apply  the  procedure  set  out  in  Part  A  (production  quality  assurance)  or  the  procedure  set  out  in  Part  B (product verification) of this Annex.
