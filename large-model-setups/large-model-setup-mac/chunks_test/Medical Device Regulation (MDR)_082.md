## . Design and manufacture of devices
Devices  shall  be  designed  and  manufactured  in  such  a  way  as  to  reduce  as  far  as  possible  the  risks  posed  by substances  or  particles,  including  wear  debris,  degradation  products  and  processing  residues,  that  may  be released from the device.
Devices, or  those parts thereof or  those materials used therein that:
- -  are invasive and come into direct contact with the human body,
- -  (re)administer medicines, body liquids or other substances, including gases, to/from the body, or
- -  transport  or  store  such  medicines,  body  fluids  or  substances,  including  gases,  to  be  (re)administered  to  the body,
shall  only  contain  the  following  substances  in  a  concentration  that  is  above  0,1  %  weight  by  weight  (w/w) where justified pursuant to Section :
- (a)   substances  which  are  carcinogenic,  mutagenic  or  toxic  to  reproduction  ('CMR'),  of  category  1A  or  1B,  in accordance  with  Part  3  of  Annex  VI  to  Regulation  (EC)  No  1272/2008  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of the Council  ( 1 ),  or
- (b)   substances  having  endocrine-disrupting properties  for  which  there  is  scientific  evidence  of  probable  serious effects  to  human  health  and  which  are  identified  either  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  set  out  in Article  59  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1907/2006  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  ( 2 )  or,  once a  delegated  act  has  been  adopted  by  the  Commission  pursuant  to  the  first  subparagraph  of  Article  5(3)  of Regulation  (EU)  No  528/2012  of  the  European  Parliament  and  the  Council  ( 3 ),  in  accordance  with  the criteria that are relevant to human health amongst the criteria established therein.
## . Justification regarding the presence of CMR and/or endocrine-disrupting substances
The justification for  the presence of such substances shall be based upon:
- (a)   an  analysis and estimation of potential patient or  user exposure to the substance;
- (b)   an  analysis  of  possible  alternative  substances,  materials  or  designs,  including,  where  available,  information about  independent  research,  peer-reviewed  studies,  scientific  opinions  from  relevant  scientific  committees and an analysis of the availability of such alternatives;
- (c)   argumentation  as  to  why  possible  substance  and/  or  material  substitutes,  if  available,  or  design  changes,  if feasible,  are  inappropriate  in  relation  to  maintaining  the  functionality,  performance  and  the  benefit-risk ratios  of  the  product;  including  taking  into  account  if  the  intended  use  of  such  devices  includes  treatment of children  or treatment  of  pregnant  or  breastfeeding  women  or treatment  of  other patient  groups considered particularly vulnerable to such substances and/or materials; and
- (d)   where  applicable  and  available,  the  latest  relevant  scientific  committee  guidelines  in  accordance  with Sections . and .
## . Guidelines on phthalates
For  the purposes of Section ., the Commission shall, as soon as possible and by 26 May 2018, provide the relevant scientific  committee with a mandate to prepare guidelines that shall be ready before 26 May 2020. The mandate  for  the  committee  shall  encompass  at  least  a  benefit-risk  assessment  of  the  presence  of  phthalates which  belong  to  either  of  the  groups  of  substances  referred  to  in  points  (a)  and  (b)  of  Section  .  The benefit-risk  assessment  shall  take  into  account  the  intended  purpose  and  context  of  the  use  of  the  device,  as well  as  any  available  alternative  substances  and  alternative  materials,  designs  or  medical  treatments.
