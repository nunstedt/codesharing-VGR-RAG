If  an  entity  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  1,  point  (b),  is  not  established  in  the  Union,  but  offers  services  within  the Union,  it  shall  designate  a  representative  in  the  Union.  The  representative  shall  be  established  in  one  of  those  Member States where the services are offered. Such an entity shall be considered to fall under the jurisdiction of the Member State where the representative is established. In  the absence  of a  representative  in  the  Union  designated  under  this  paragraph, any Member State in which the entity provides services may take legal actions against the entity for  the infringement of this Directive.
