## Guidance
The organization should establish and communicate a topic-specific policy on supplier relationships to all relevant interested parties.
The organization should identify and implement processes and procedures to address security risks associated with the use of products and services provided by suppliers. This should also apply to the organization's  use  of  resources  of  cloud  service  providers.  These  processes  and  procedures  should include those to be implemented by the organization, as well as those the organization requires the supplier  to  implement  for  the  commencement  of  use  of  a  supplier's  products  or  services  or  for  the termination of use of a supplier's products and services, such as:
- a) identifying and documenting the types of suppliers (e.g. ICT services, logistics, utilities, financial services,  ICT  infrastructure  components)  which  can  affect  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and availability of the organization's information;
- b) establishing  how  to  evaluate  and  select  suppliers  according  to  the  sensitivity  of  information, products and services (e.g. with market analysis, customer references, review of documents, onsite assessments, certifications);
- c) evaluating and selecting supplier's products or services that have adequate information security controls and reviewing them; in particular, accuracy and completeness of controls implemented by the supplier that ensure integrity of the supplier's information and information processing and hence the organization's information security;
- d) defining the organization's information, ICT services and the physical infrastructure that suppliers can access, monitor, control or use;
- e) defining the types of ICT infrastructure components and services provided by suppliers which can affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the organization's information;
- f) assessing and managing the information security risks associated with:
- 1) the suppliers' use of the organization's information and other associated assets, including risks originating from potential malicious supplier personnel;
- 2) malfunctioning or vulnerabilities  of  the  products  (including  software  components  and  subcomponents used in these products) or services provided by the suppliers;
- g) monitoring  compliance  with  established  information  security  requirements  for  each  type  of supplier and type of access, including third-party review and product validation;
- h) mitigating  non-compliance  of  a  supplier,  whether  this  was  detected  through  monitoring  or  by other means;
- i) handling  incidents  and  contingencies  associated  with  supplier  products  and  services  including responsibilities of both the organization and suppliers;
- j) resilience and, if necessary, recovery and contingency measures to ensure the availability of the supplier's information and information processing and hence the availability of the organization's information;
- k) awareness  and  training  for  the  organization's  personnel  interacting  with  supplier  personnel regarding  appropriate  rules  of  engagement,  topic-specific  policies,  processes  and  procedures and behaviour based on the type of supplier and the level of supplier access to the organization's systems and information;
- l) managing the necessary transfer of information, other associated assets and anything else that needs  to  be  changed  and  ensuring  that  information  security  is  maintained  throughout  the transfer period;
- m)  requirements to ensure a secure termination of the supplier relationship, including:
- 1) de-provisioning of access rights;
- 2) information handling;
- 3) determining ownership of intellectual property developed during the engagement;
- 4) information portability in case of change of supplier or insourcing;
- 6) records management;
- 7) return of assets;
- 8) secure disposal of information and other associated assets;
- 9) ongoing confidentiality requirements;
- n) level of personnel security and physical security expected from supplier's personnel and facilities.
The procedures for continuing information processing in the event that the supplier becomes unable to supply its products or services (e.g. because of an incident, because the supplier is no longer in business, or  no  longer  provides  some  components  due  to  technology  advancements)  should  be  considered  to avoid any delay in arranging replacement products or services (e.g. identifying an alternative supplier in advance or always using alternative suppliers).
## Other information
In  cases  where  it  is  not  possible  for  an  organization  to  place  requirements  on  a  supplier,  the organization should:
- a) consider the guidance given in this control in making decisions about choosing a supplier and its product or service;
- b) implement compensating controls as necessary based on a risk assessment.
Information can be put at risk by suppliers with inadequate information security management. Controls should be determined and applied to manage the supplier's access to information and other associated assets.  For  example,  if  there  is  a  special  need  for  confidentiality  of  the  information,  non-disclosure agreements or cryptographic techniques can be used. Another example is personal data protection risks when the supplier agreement involves transfer of, or access to, information across borders. The organization needs to be aware that the legal or contractual responsibility for protecting information remains with the organization.
Risks can also be caused by inadequate controls of ICT infrastructure components or services provided by  suppliers.  Malfunctioning  or  vulnerable  components  or  services  can  cause  information  security breaches in the organization or to another entity (e.g.
