- (90) The power  to adopt delegated  acts  in  accordance  with  Article  290  TFEU  should  be  delegated  to  the  Commission in  order  to  amend  certain  non-essential  provisions  of  this  Regulation.  It  is  of  particular  importance  that  the Commission  carry  out  appropriate  consultations  during  its  preparatory  work,  including  at  expert  level,  and  that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of  13  April  2016  on  Better  Law-Making ( 1 ).  In  particular,  to  ensure  equal  participation  in  the  preparation  of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts,  and  their  experts  systematically  have  access  to  meetings  of  Commission  expert  groups  dealing  with preparation of delegated acts.
