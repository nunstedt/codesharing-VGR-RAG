Additionally, such processes and  governance  should  be  extended  to  cover  software  components  from  third  parties  and  open source software.
The organization should monitor real world threats and up-to-date advice and information on software vulnerabilities to guide the organization's secure coding principles through continual improvement and learning. This can help with ensuring effective secure coding practices are implemented to combat the fast-changing threat landscape.
## Planning and before coding
Secure  coding  principles  should  be  used  both  for  new  developments  and  in  reuse  scenarios.  These principles should be applied to development activities both within the organization and for products and  services  supplied  by  the  organization  to  others.  Planning  and  prerequisites  before  coding should include:
- a) organization-specific expectations and approved principles for secure coding to be used for both in-house and outsourced code developments;
- b) common and historical coding practices and defects that lead to information security vulnerabilities;
- c) configuring development tools, such as integrated development environments (IDE), to help enforce the creation of secure code;
- d) following  guidance  issued  by  the  providers  of  development  tools  and  execution  environments as applicable;
- e) maintenance and use of updated development tools (e.g. compilers);
- f) qualification of developers in writing secure code;
- g) secure design and architecture, including threat modelling;
- h) secure coding standards and where relevant mandating their use;
- i) use of controlled environments for development.
## During coding
Considerations during coding should include:
- a) secure coding practices specific to the programming languages and techniques being used;
- b) using  secure  programming  techniques,  such  as  pair  programming,  refactoring,  peer  review, security iterations and test-driven development;
- c) using structured programming techniques;
- d) documenting  code  and  removing  programming  defects,  which  can  allow  information  security vulnerabilities to be exploited;
- e) prohibiting the use of insecure design techniques (e.g. the use of hard-coded passwords, unapproved code samples and unauthenticated web services).
Testing should be conducted during and after development (see ). Static application security testing (SAST) processes can identify security vulnerabilities in software.
Before software is made operational, the following should be evaluated:
- a) attack surface and the principle of least privilege;
- b) conducting an analysis of the most common programming errors and documenting that these have been mitigated.
## Review and maintenance
After code has been made operational:
- a) updates should be securely packaged and deployed;
- b) reported information security vulnerabilities should be handled (see  );
- c) errors and suspected attacks should be logged and logs regularly reviewed to make adjustments to the code as necessary;
- d) source  code  should  be  protected  against  unauthorized  access  and  tampering  (e.g.  by  using configuration  management  tools,  which  typically  provide  features  such  as  access  control  and version control).
If using external tools and libraries, the organization should consider:
- a) ensuring that external libraries are managed (e.g. by maintaining an inventory of libraries used and their versions) and regularly updated with release cycles;
- b) selection,  authorization  and  reuse  of  well-vetted  components,  particularly  authentication  and cryptographic components;
- c) the licence, security and history of external components;
- d) ensuring that software is maintainable, tracked and originates from proven, reputable sources;
- e) sufficiently long-term availability of development resources and artefacts.
