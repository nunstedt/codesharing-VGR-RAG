In  cases  of  management-initiated  termination,  disgruntled  personnel  or  external  party  users  can deliberately  corrupt  information  or  sabotage  information  processing  facilities.  In  cases  of  persons resigning or being dismissed, they can be tempted to collect information for future use.
Cloning  is  an  efficient  way  for  organizations  to  assign  access  to  users.  However,  it  should  be  done with care based on distinct roles identified by the organization rather than just cloning an identity with all associated access rights. Cloning has an inherent risk of resulting in excessive access rights to information and other associated assets.
