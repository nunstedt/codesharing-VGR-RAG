An  AI  system  that  does  not  materially  influence  the  outcome  of decision-making  could  include  situations  in  which  one  or  more  of  the  following  conditions  are  fulfilled.  The  first such condition should be that the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that  transforms  unstructured  data  into  structured  data,  an  AI  system  that  classifies  incoming  documents  into categories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications.
