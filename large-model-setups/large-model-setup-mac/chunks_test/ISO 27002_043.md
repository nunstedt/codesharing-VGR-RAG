## Purpose
To ensure the security of information when personnel are working remotely.
## Guidance
Remote  working  occurs  whenever  personnel  of  the  organization  work  from  a  location  outside  of the  organization's  premises,  accessing  information  whether  in  hardcopy  or  electronically  via  ICT equipment. Remote working environments include those referred to as 'teleworking', 'telecommuting', 'flexible workplace', 'virtual work environments" and 'remote maintenance'.
NOTE It is possible that not all the recommendations in this guidance can be applied due to local legislation and regulations in different jurisdictions.
Organizations  allowing  remote  working  activities  should  issue  a  topic-specific  policy  on  remote working that defines the relevant conditions and restrictions. Where deemed applicable, the following matters should be considered:
- a) the  existing  or  proposed  physical  security  of  the  remote  working  site,  taking  into  account  the physical security of the location and the local environment, including the different jurisdictions where personnel are located;
- b) rules  and  security  mechanisms  for  the  remote  physical  environment  such  as  lockable  filing cabinets,  secure  transportation  between  locations  and  rules  for  remote  access,  clear  desk, printing and disposal of information and other associated assets, and information security event reporting (see  );
- c) the expected physical remote working environments;
- d) the  communications  security  requirements,  taking  into  account  the  need  for  remote  access  to the organization's systems, the sensitivity of the information to be accessed and passed over the communication link and the sensitivity of the systems and applications;
- e) the use of remote access such as virtual desktop access that supports processing and storage of information on privately owned equipment;
- f) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons at the remote working site (e.g. family and friends);
- g) the threat of unauthorized access to information or resources from other persons in public places;
- h) the  use  of  home  networks  and  public  networks,  and  requirements  or  restrictions  on  the configuration of wireless network services;
- i) use of security measures, such as firewalls and protection against malware;
- j) secure mechanisms for deploying and initializing systems remotely;
- k) secure mechanisms for authentication and enablement of access privileges taking into consideration the vulnerability of single-factor authentication mechanisms where remote access to the organization's network is allowed.
The guidelines and measures to be considered should include:
- a) the  provision  of  suitable  equipment  and  storage  furniture  for  the  remote  working  activities, where the use of privately-owned equipment that is not under the control of the organization is not allowed;
- b) a definition of the work permitted, the classification of information that can be held and the internal systems and services that the remote worker is authorized to access;
- c) the  provision  of  training  for  those  working  remotely  and  those  providing  support.  This  should include how to conduct business in a secure manner while working remotely;
- d) the provision of suitable communication equipment, including methods for securing remote access, such as requirements on device screen locks and inactivity timers; the enabling of device location tracking; installation of remote wipe capabilities;
- e) physical security;
- f) rules and guidance on family and visitor access to equipment and information;
- g) the provision of hardware and software support and maintenance;
- h) the provision of insurance;
- i) the procedures for backup and business continuity;
- j) audit and security monitoring;
- k) revocation of authority and access rights and the return of equipment when the remote working activities are terminated.

## Control
The  organization  should  provide  a  mechanism  for  personnel  to  report  observed  or  suspected information security events through appropriate channels in a timely manner.
## Purpose
To  support  timely,  consistent  and  effective  reporting  of  information  security  events  that  can  be identified by personnel.
## Guidance
All personnel and users should be made aware of their responsibility to report information security events as quickly as possible in order to prevent or minimize the effect of information security incidents.
They should also be aware of the procedure for reporting information security events and the point of contact to which the events should be reported. The reporting mechanism should be as easy, accessible and available as possible. Information security events include incidents, breaches and vulnerabilities.
Situations to be considered for information security event reporting include:
- a) ineffective information security controls;
- b) breach of information confidentiality, integrity or availability expectations;
- c) human errors;
- d) non-compliance with the information security policy, topic-specific policies or applicable standards;
- e) breaches of physical security measures;
- f) system changes that have not gone through the change management process;
- g) malfunctions or other anomalous system behaviour of software or hardware;
- h) access violations;
- i) vulnerabilities;
- j) suspected malware infection.
Personnel  and  users  should  be  advised  not  to  attempt  to  prove  suspected  information  security vulnerabilities.
