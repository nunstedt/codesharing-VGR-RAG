## Purpose
To maintain confidentiality of information accessible by personnel or external parties.
## Guidance
Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements should address the requirement to protect confidential information  using  legally  enforceable  terms.  Confidentiality  or  non-disclosure  agreements  are applicable  to  interested  parties  and  personnel  of  the  organization.  Based  on  an  organization's information  security  requirements,  the  terms  in  the  agreements  should  be  determined  by  taking into consideration the type of information that will be handled, its classification level, its use and the permissible access by the other party. To identify requirements for confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, the following elements should be considered:
- a) a definition of the information to be protected (e.g. confidential information);
- b) the  expected  duration  of  an  agreement,  including  cases  where  it  can  be  necessary  to  maintain confidentiality indefinitely or until the information becomes publicly available;
- c) the required actions when an agreement is terminated;
- d) the responsibilities and actions of signatories to avoid unauthorized information disclosure;
- e) the ownership of information, trade secrets and intellectual property, and how this relates to the protection of confidential information;
- f) the permitted use of confidential information and rights of the signatory to use the information;
- g) the right to audit and monitor activities that involve confidential information for highly sensitive circumstances;
- h) the process for notification and reporting of unauthorized disclosure or confidential information leakage;
- i) the terms for information to be returned or destroyed at agreement termination;
- j) the expected actions to be taken in the case of non-compliance with the agreement.
The organization should take into consideration the compliance with confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements for the jurisdiction to which they apply (see , , , ).
Requirements for confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements should be reviewed periodically and when changes occur that influence these requirements.
## Other information
Confidentiality  and  non-disclosure  agreements  protect  the  organization's  information  and  inform signatories  of  their  responsibility  to  protect,  use  and  disclose  information  in  a  responsible  and authorized manner.
