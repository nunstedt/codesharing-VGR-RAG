## CHAPTER IX
## POST-MARKET MONITORING, INFORMATION SHARING AND MARKET SURVEILLANCE
## SECTION 1
## Post-market  monitoring
## Article  72
## Post-market monitoring by providers and post-market monitoring plan for high-risk AI systems
- 1. Providers  shall  establish  and  document  a  post-market  monitoring  system  in  a  manner  that  is  proportionate  to  the nature  of  the  AI  technologies  and  the  risks  of  the  high-risk  AI  system.
- 2. The  post-market  monitoring  system  shall  actively  and  systematically  collect,  document  and  analyse  relevant  data which may be provided by deployers or which may be collected through other sources on the performance of high-risk AI systems throughout their lifetime, and which allow the provider to evaluate the continuous compliance of AI systems with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2. Where relevant, post-market monitoring shall include an analysis of the interaction  with  other  AI  systems.  This  obligation  shall  not  cover  sensitive  operational  data  of  deployers  which  are law-enforcement authorities.
- 3. The post-market monitoring system shall be based on a post-market monitoring plan. The post-market monitoring plan shall be part of the technical documentation referred to in Annex IV. The Commission shall adopt an implementing act laying down detailed provisions establishing a template for the post-market monitoring plan and the list of elements to be included  in  the  plan  by  2  February  2026.  That  implementing  act  shall  be  adopted  in  accordance  with  the  examination procedure referred  to in  Article  98(2).
- 4. For  high-risk  AI  systems  covered  by  the  Union  harmonisation  legislation  listed  in  Section  A  of  Annex  I,  where a  post-market  monitoring  system  and  plan  are  already  established  under  that  legislation,  in  order  to  ensure  consistency, avoid  duplications  and  minimise  additional  burdens,  providers  shall  have  a  choice  of  integrating,  as  appropriate,  the necessary elements described in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 using the template referred in paragraph 3 into systems and plans already  existing  under  that  legislation,  provided  that  it  achieves  an  equivalent  level  of  protection.
The first subparagraph of this paragraph shall also apply to high-risk AI systems referred to in point 5 of Annex III placed on the market or put into service by financial institutions that are subject to requirements under Union financial services law regarding their  internal  governance,  arrangements  or  processes.
## SECTION 2
## Sharing of information on serious incidents
## Article  73
## Reporting of serious incidents
- 1. Providers  of  high-risk  AI  systems  placed  on  the  Union  market  shall  report  any  serious  incident  to  the  market surveillance  authorities  of  the  Member  States  where  that  incident  occurred.
- 2. The  report  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  shall  be  made  immediately  after  the  provider  has  established  a  causal  link between the AI system and the serious incident or the reasonable likelihood of such a link, and, in any event, not later than 15 days after  the  provider  or,  where  applicable,  the  deployer,  becomes  aware  of  the  serious  incident.
The period for the reporting referred to in the first subparagraph shall take account of the severity of the serious incident.
- 3. Notwithstanding  paragraph  2  of  this  Article,  in  the  event  of  a  widespread  infringement  or  a  serious  incident  as defined in Article 3, point (49)(b), the report referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be provided immediately, and not  later  than  two  days  after  the  provider  or,  where  applicable,  the  deployer  becomes  aware  of  that  incident.
- 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, in the event of the death of a person, the report shall be provided immediately after the provider or the deployer has established, or as soon as it suspects, a causal relationship between the high-risk AI system and the  serious  incident,  but  not  later  than  10  days  after  the  date  on  which  the  provider  or,  where  applicable,  the  deployer becomes aware of  the  serious  incident.
- 5. Where necessary  to  ensure  timely  reporting,  the  provider  or,  where  applicable,  the  deployer,  may  submit  an  initial report  that  is  incomplete,  followed  by  a  complete  report.
- 6. Following the reporting of a serious incident pursuant to paragraph 1, the provider shall, without delay, perform the necessary investigations in relation to the serious incident and the AI system concerned. This shall include a risk assessment of  the  incident,  and  corrective  action.
The provider shall cooperate with the competent authorities, and where relevant with the notified body concerned, during the investigations referred to in the first subparagraph, and shall not perform any investigation which involves altering the AI system concerned in a way which may affect any subsequent evaluation of the causes of the incident, prior to informing the  competent  authorities  of  such  action.
- 7. Upon receiving a notification related to a serious incident referred to in Article 3, point (49)(c), the relevant market surveillance authority shall inform the national public authorities or bodies referred  to in Article 77(1). The Commission shall  develop  dedicated guidance to facilitate compliance  with the obligations set out  in paragraph 1  of  this  Article.  That guidance shall  be  issued  by  2  August  2025,  and  shall  be  assessed  regularly.
- 8. The market surveillance authority shall take appropriate measures, as provided for  in Article 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, within seven days from the date it received the notification referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, and shall follow  the  notification  procedures  as  provided  in  that  Regulation.
- 9. For high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III that are placed on the market or put into service by providers that are subject to Union legislative instruments laying down reporting obligations equivalent to those set out in this Regulation, the notification  of  serious  incidents  shall  be  limited  to  those  referred  to  in  Article  3,  point  (49)(c).
- 10. For high-risk AI systems which are safety components of devices, or are themselves devices, covered by Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, the notification of serious incidents shall be limited to those referred to in Article 3, point  (49)(c)  of  this  Regulation,  and  shall  be  made  to  the  national  competent  authority  chosen  for  that  purpose  by  the Member States where the incident occurred.
- 11. National  competent  authorities  shall  immediately  notify  the  Commission  of  any  serious  incident,  whether  or  not they have  taken  action  on  it,  in  accordance  with  Article  20  of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/1020.
## SECTION 3
## Enforcement
## Article  74
## Market surveillance and control of AI systems in the Union market
- 1. Regulation  (EU)  2019/1020 shall apply to AI systems covered by this Regulation. For  the purposes of  the effective enforcement of  this  Regulation:
- (a) any reference to an economic operator under Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall be understood as including all operators identified  in  Article  2(1)  of  this  Regulation;
- (b) any  reference  to  a  product  under  Regulation  (EU)  2019/1020  shall  be  understood  as  including  all  AI  systems  falling within  the  scope  of  this  Regulation.
- 2. As  part  of  their  reporting  obligations  under  Article  34(4)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/1020,  the  market  surveillance authorities  shall  report  annually  to  the  Commission  and  relevant  national  competition  authorities  any  information identified in the course of market surveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the application of Union law on competition rules. They shall also annually report to the Commission about the use of prohibited practices that occurred during that  year  and  about  the  measures  taken.
- 3. For  high-risk  AI  systems  related  to  products  covered  by  the  Union  harmonisation  legislation  listed  in  Section  A  of Annex I, the market surveillance authority for the purposes of this Regulation shall be the authority responsible for market surveillance  activities  designated  under  those  legal  acts.
By  derogation  from  the  first  subparagraph,  and  in  appropriate  circumstances,  Member  States  may  designate  another relevant  authority  to  act  as  a  market  surveillance  authority,  provided  they  ensure  coordination  with  the  relevant  sectoral market surveillance authorities responsible for  the  enforcement of  the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I.
- 4. The procedures referred to in Articles 79 to 83 of this Regulation shall not apply to AI systems related to products covered by the  Union  harmonisation  legislation  listed  in  section  A of  Annex  I,  where  such  legal  acts  already  provide  for procedures  ensuring  an  equivalent  level  of  protection  and  having  the  same  objective.  In  such  cases,  the  relevant  sectoral procedures shall  apply  instead.
- 5. Without prejudice to the powers of market surveillance authorities under Article 14 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, for  the  purpose of ensuring the effective enforcement of  this Regulation, market surveillance authorities may exercise the powers referred  to in  Article  14(4),  points  (d)  and  (j),  of  that  Regulation  remotely,  as  appropriate.
- 6. For high-risk AI systems placed on the market, put into service, or used by financial institutions regulated by Union financial  services  law,  the  market  surveillance  authority  for  the  purposes  of  this  Regulation  shall  be  the  relevant  national authority responsible for the financial supervision of those institutions under that legislation in so far as the placing on the market,  putting  into  service,  or  the  use  of  the  AI  system  is  in  direct  connection  with  the  provision  of  those  financial services.
- 7. By  way  of  derogation  from  paragraph  6,  in  appropriate  circumstances,  and  provided  that  coordination  is  ensured, another relevant authority may be identified by the Member State as market surveillance authority for the purposes of this Regulation.
National  market  surveillance  authorities  supervising  regulated  credit  institutions  regulated  under  Directive  2013/36/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism established by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013, should report, without delay, to the European Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market surveillance activities that  may  be  of  potential  interest  for  the  prudential  supervisory  tasks  of  the  European  Central  Bank  specified  in  that Regulation.
- 8. For  high-risk  AI  systems  listed  in  point  1  of  Annex  III  to  this  Regulation,  in  so  far  as  the  systems  are  used  for  law enforcement purposes, border  management and justice and democracy, and for high-risk AI systems listed in points 6, 7 and 8 of Annex III to this Regulation, Member States shall designate as market surveillance authorities for the purposes of this Regulation either the competent data protection supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Directive (EU)  2016/680,  or  any  other  authority  designated  pursuant  to  the  same  conditions  laid  down  in  Articles  41  to  44  of Directive  (EU)  2016/680.  Market  surveillance  activities  shall  in  no  way  affect  the  independence  of  judicial  authorities,  or otherwise  interfere  with  their  activities  when  acting  in  their  judicial  capacity.
- 9. Where  Union  institutions,  bodies,  offices  or  agencies  fall  within  the  scope  of  this  Regulation,  the  European  Data Protection  Supervisor  shall  act  as  their  market  surveillance  authority,  except  in  relation  to  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the European Union acting in its judicial  capacity.
