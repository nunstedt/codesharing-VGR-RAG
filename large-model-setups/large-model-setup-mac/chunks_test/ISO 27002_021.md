## Verbal transfer
To protect verbal transfer of information, personnel and other interested parties should be reminded that they should:
- a) not  have  confidential  verbal  conversations  in  public  places  or  over  insecure  communication channels since these can be overheard by unauthorized persons;
- b) not leave messages containing confidential information on answering machines or voice messages since  these  can  be  replayed  by  unauthorized  persons,  stored  on  communal  systems  or  stored incorrectly as a result of misdialling;
- c) be screened to the appropriate level to listen to the conversation;
- d) ensure that appropriate room controls are implemented (e.g. sound-proofing, closed door);
- e) begin any sensitive conversations with a disclaimer so those present know the classification level and any handling requirements of what they are about to hear.
