## TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION ON POST-MARKET SURVEILLANCE
The  technical  documentation  on  post-market  surveillance  to  be  drawn  up  by  the  manufacturer  in  accordance  with Articles  83  to  86  shall  be  presented  in  a  clear,  organised,  readily  searchable  and  unambiguous  manner  and  shall  include in particular  the elements described in this Annex.
- . The post-market surveillance plan drawn up in accordance with Article 84.
The  manufacturer  shall  prove  in  a  post-market  surveillance  plan  that  it  complies  with  the  obligation  referred  to in Article 83.
- (a)   The  post-market  surveillance  plan  shall  address  the  collection  and  utilization  of  available  information,  in particular:
- -  information  concerning  serious  incidents,  including  information  from  PSURs,  and  field  safety  corrective actions;
- -  records referring to non-serious incidents and data on any undesirable side-effects;
- -  information from trend reporting;
- -  relevant specialist or  technical literature, databases and/or  registers;
- -  information, including feedbacks and complaints, provided by users, distributors and importers; and
- -  publicly available information about similar medical devices.
- (b)   The post-market surveillance plan shall cover at least:
- -  a  proactive  and  systematic  process  to  collect  any  information  referred  to  in  point  (a).  The  process  shall allow  a  correct  characterisation  of  the  performance  of  the  devices  and  shall  also  allow  a  comparison  to be made between the device and similar products available on the market;
- -  effective and appropriate methods and processes to assess the collected data;
- -  suitable  indicators  and  threshold  values  that  shall  be  used  in  the  continuous  reassessment  of  the  benefit- risk analysis and of the risk management as referred to in Section 3 of Annex I;
- -  effective and appropriate methods  and  tools to investigate complaints and analyse market-related experience collected in the field;
- -  methods  and  protocols  to  manage  the  events  subject  to  the  trend  report  as  provided  for  in  Article  88, including  the  methods  and  protocols  to  be  used  to  establish  any  statistically  significant  increase  in  the frequency or severity of incidents as well as the observation period;
- -  methods and protocols to communicate effectively with competent authorities, notified bodies, economic operators and users;
- -  reference to procedures to fulfil the manufacturers obligations laid down in Articles 83, 84 and 86;
- -  systematic procedures to identify and initiate appropriate measures including corrective actions;
- -  effective tools to trace and identify devices for  which corrective actions might be necessary; and
- -  a PMCF plan as referred to in Part B of Annex XIV, or a justification as to why a PMCF is not applicable.
- . The PSUR referred to in Article 86 and the post-market surveillance report referred to in Article 85.
