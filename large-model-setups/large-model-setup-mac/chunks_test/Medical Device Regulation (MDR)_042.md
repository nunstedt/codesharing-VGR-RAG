## Article 55
## Mechanism for scrutiny of conformity assessments of certain class III and class IIb devices
- 1. A  notified  body  shall  notify  the  competent  authorities  of  certificates  it  has  granted  to  devices  for  which  the conformity  assessment  has  been  performed  pursuant  to  Article  54(1).  Such  notification  shall  take  place  through  the electronic system referred to in Article 57 and shall include the summary of safety and clinical performance pursuant to Article  32,  the  assessment  report  by  the  notified  body,  the  instructions  for  use  referred  to  in  Section    of  Annex  I, and,  where  applicable,  the  scientific  opinion  of  the  expert  panels  referred  to  in  Section    of  Annex  IX or  Section  6  of Annex  X,  as  applicable.  In  the  case  of  divergent  views  between  the  notified  body  and  the  expert  panels,  a  full  justifiÂ­ cation shall also be included.
- 2. A  competent  authority  and,  where  applicable,  the  Commission  may,  based  on  reasonable  concerns  apply  further procedures in accordance with Article 44, 45, 46, 47 or 94 and, where deemed necessary, take appropriate measures in accordance with Articles 95 and 97.
- 3. The  MDCG  and,  where  applicable,  the  Commission,  may,  based  on  reasonable  concerns,  request  scientific  advice from the expert panels in relation to the safety and performance of any device.
## Article 56
## Certificates of conformity
- 1. The certificates issued by the notified bodies in accordance with Annexes IX, X and XI shall be in an official Union language  determined  by  the  Member  State  in  which  the  notified  body  is  established  or  otherwise  in  an  official  Union language acceptable to the notified body. The minimum content of the certificates shall be as set out in Annex XII.
- 2. The certificates  shall  be  valid  for  the  period  they  indicate,  which  shall  not  exceed  five  years.  On  application  by  the manufacturer, the validity of  the certificate  may  be  extended  for  further  periods,  each not exceeding five  years, based  on a  re-assessment  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  conformity  assessment  procedures.  Any  supplement  to  a  certificate shall remain valid as long as the certificate which it supplements is valid.
- 3. Notified  bodies  may  impose  restrictions  to  the  intended  purpose  of  a  device  to  certain  groups  of  patients  or require manufacturers to undertake specific PMCF studies pursuant to Part B of Annex XIV. - 4. Where  a  notified  body  finds  that  the  requirements  of  this  Regulation  are  no  longer  met  by  the  manufacturer,  it shall,  taking  account  of  the  principle  of  proportionality,  suspend  or  withdraw  the  certificate  issued  or  impose  any restrictions  on  it  unless  compliance  with  such  requirements  is  ensured  by  appropriate  corrective  action  taken  by  the manufacturer  within  an  appropriate  deadline  set  by  the  notified  body.  The  notified  body  shall  give  the  reasons  for  its decision.
- 5. The  notified  body  shall  enter  in  the  electronic  system  referred  to  in  Article  57  any  information  regarding certificates  issued,  including  amendments  and  supplements  thereto,  and  regarding  suspended,  reinstated,  withdrawn  or refused certificates and restrictions imposed on certificates. Such information shall be accessible to the public.
- 6. In  the  light  of  technical  progress,  the  Commission  is  empowered  to  adopt  delegated  acts  in  accordance  with Article 115 amending the minimum content of the certificates set out in Annex XII.

## CHAPTER VI
## CLINICAL EVALUATION AND CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS
## Article 61
## Clinical evaluation
- 1. Confirmation  of  conformity  with  relevant  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  set  out  in  Annex  I  under the  normal  conditions  of  the  intended  use  of  the  device,  and  the  evaluation  of  the  undesirable  side-effects  and  of  the acceptability  of  the  benefit-risk-  ratio  referred  to  in  Sections  1  and  8  of  Annex  I,  shall  be  based  on  clinical  data providing sufficient clinical evidence, including where applicable relevant data as referred to in Annex III.
The  manufacturer  shall  specify  and  justify  the  level  of  clinical  evidence  necessary  to  demonstrate  conformity  with  the relevant  general  safety  and  performance  requirements.  That  level  of  clinical  evidence  shall  be  appropriate  in  view  of  the characteristics of the device and its intended purpose.
To  that  end,  manufacturers  shall  plan,  conduct  and  document  a  clinical  evaluation  in  accordance  with  this  Article  and Part A of Annex XIV. - 2. For all  class  III  devices  and  for  the  class  IIb  devices  referred  to  in  point  (b)  of  Article  54(1),  the  manufacturer  may, prior  to its  clinical  evaluation and/or  investigation, consult an expert panel as referred to in Article 106, with the aim of reviewing  the manufacturer's  intended  clinical  development  strategy  and  proposals  for clinical investigation.  The manufacturer  shall  give  due  consideration  to  the  views  expressed  by  the  expert  panel.  Such  consideration  shall  be documented in the clinical evaluation report referred to in paragraph 12 of this Article.
The  manufacturer  may  not  invoke  any  rights  to  the  views  expressed  by  the  expert  panel  with  regard  to  any  future conformity assessment procedure.
- 3. A clinical evaluation shall follow a defined and methodologically sound procedure based on the following:
- (a)   a  critical  evaluation  of  the  relevant  scientific  literature  currently  available  relating  to  the  safety,  performance,  design characteristics and intended purpose of the device, where the following conditions are satisfied:
- -  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  device  subject  to  clinical  evaluation  for  the  intended  purpose  is  equivalent  to  the device to which the data relate, in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV, and
- -  the data adequately demonstrate compliance with the relevant general safety and performance requirements;
- (b)   a  critical  evaluation  of  the  results  of  all  available  clinical  investigations,  taking  duly  into  consideration  whether  the investigations were performed under Articles 62 to 80, any acts adopted pursuant to Article 81, and Annex XV; and
- (c)   a  consideration of currently available alternative treatment options for  that purpose, if any.
- 4. In the case of implantable devices and class III devices, clinical investigations shall be performed, except if:
- -  the device has been designed by modifications of a device already marketed by the same manufacturer,
- -  the  modified  device  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  manufacturer  to  be  equivalent  to  the  marketed  device,  in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV and this demonstration has been endorsed by the notified body, and
- -  the clinical evaluation of  the marketed device is sufficient to demonstrate conformity of  the modified device with the relevant safety and performance requirements.
In  this  case,  the  notified  body  shall  check  that  the  PMCF  plan  is  appropriate  and  includes  post  market  studies  to demonstrate the safety and performance of the device.
In addition, clinical investigations need not be performed in the cases referred to in paragraph 6.
- 5. A  manufacturer  of  a  device  demonstrated  to  be  equivalent  to  an  already  marketed  device  not  manufactured  by him,  may  also  rely  on  paragraph  4  in  order  not  to  perform  a  clinical  investigation  provided  that  the  following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what is required in that paragraph:
- -  the  two  manufacturers  have  a  contract  in  place  that  explicitly  allows  the  manufacturer  of  the  second  device  full access to the technical documentation on an ongoing basis, and
- -  the original clinical evaluation has been performed in compliance with the requirements of this Regulation,
- and the manufacturer of the second device provides clear evidence thereof to the notified body.
- 6. The requirement  to  perform  clinical  investigations  pursuant  to  paragraph  4  shall  not  apply  to  implantable  devices and class III devices:
- (a)   which  have  been  lawfully  placed  on  the  market  or  put  into  service  in  accordance  with  Directive  90/385/EEC  or Directive 93/42/EEC and for which the clinical evaluation:
- -  is based on sufficient clinical data, and
- -  is  in  compliance  with  the  relevant  product-specific  CS  for  the  clinical  evaluation  of  that  kind  of  device,  where such a CS is available; or
- (b)   that  are  sutures,  staples,  dental  fillings,  dental  braces,  tooth  crowns,  screws,  wedges,  plates,  wires,  pins,  clips  or connectors for  which the clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data and is in compliance with the relevant product-specific CS, where such a CS is available. - 7. Cases  in  which  paragraph  4  is  not  applied  by  virtue  of  paragraph  6  shall  be  justified  in  the  clinical  evaluation report by the manufacturer and in the clinical evaluation assessment report by the notified body.
- 8. Where  justified  in  view  of  well-established  technologies,  similar  to  those  used  in  the  exempted  devices  listed  in point (b) of paragraph 6 of this Article, being used in other devices, or  where justified in order  to protect the health and safety  of  patients,  users  or  other  persons  or  other  aspects  of  public  health,  the  Commission  is  empowered  to  adopt delegated  acts  in  accordance  with  Article  115  to  amend  the  list  of  exempted  devices  referred  to  in  the  second subparagraph  of  Article  52(4)  and  in  point  (b)  of  paragraph  6  of  this  Article,  by  adding  other  types  of  implantable  or class III  devices to that list or  removing devices therefrom.
- 9.
