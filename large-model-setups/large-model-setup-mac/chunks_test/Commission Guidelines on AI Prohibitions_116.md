laws with stricter requirements than those laid down in Article 5(1)(h) and (2) to (7) AI Act.
## . Detailed national law on the authorisation request, the issuance and the exercise
- (417) As regards the detailed rules that apply for the request, the issuance and the exercise of the authorisation, these are to be determined by national law. Each Member State that wishes to allow the use of the systems at issue must specify in its national laws such rules, which are aimed at providing relevant and complete information as to the use of real-time RBI systems to the authorising authority to enable it to decide as to the strict necessity and proportionality of such use.
The national law permitting the use of real-time RBI systems may regulate for example,
- -  who  are  the  competent  authorities  subject  to  Article  5(1)(h)  AI  Act  and  the independent authorities in the Member State competent for issuing (or refusing) an authorisation;
- -  the detailed scope of the objectives for which real-time RBI in publicly accessible spaces  may  be  used  for  law  enforcement  purposes  (without  going  beyond  the objectives  listed  in  Article  5(1)(h)  (i)  to  (iii),  but  possibly  narrowing  them  further down;
- - providing that requests shall be in writing and requiring a detailed explanation of the specific use and the intended purpose of use for a specific criminal offence/situation which justifies its use;
- - the requirement of motivation and the submission of supporting evidence (and need of translation if relevant) for justifying the use of the system pursuing the objectives listed in Article 5(1)(h)(i) to (iii) AI Act, in particular relating to place, period, and personal scope and justifying the strict necessity and proportionality, including the relevance, sufficiency and the efficiency of the use of the system and the absence of less intrusive means;
