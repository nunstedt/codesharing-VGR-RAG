- ( 11 ) Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions and  the prudential supervision  of  credit  institutions  and  investment  firms,  amending  Directive  2002/87/EC  and  repealing Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, , p. 338).
- ( 12 ) Directive  2014/65/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  15  May  2014  on  markets  in  financial  instruments  and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (OJ L 173, , p. 349).
- ( 13 ) Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 on digital operational resilience for the financial sector and amending Regulations (EC) No 1060/2009, (EU) No 648/2012, (EU) No 600/2014, (EU) No 909/2014 and (EU) 2016/1011 (see page 1 of this Official Journal). - (23) In order to facilitate cross-border cooperation and communication and to enable the effective implementation of this Directive,  each  Member  State  should,  without  prejudice  to  the  requirements  of  sector-specific  Union  legal  acts, designate one single point of contact responsible for coordinating issues related to the resilience of critical entities and cross-border cooperation at Union level ('single point of contact'), where relevant within a competent authority. Each  single  point  of  contact  should  liaise  and  coordinate  communication,  where  relevant,  with  the  competent authorities  of  its  Member  State,  with  the  single  points  of  contact  of  other  Member  States  and  with  the  Critical Entities Resilience Group.
- (24) The  competent  authorities  under  this  Directive  and  the  competent  authorities  under  Directive  (EU)  2022/2555 should cooperate and exchange information in relation to cybersecurity risks, cyber threats and cyber incidents and non-cyber risks, threats and incidents affecting critical entities as well as in relation to relevant measures taken by competent  authorities  under  this  Directive  and  competent  authorities  under  Directive  (EU)  2022/2555.  It  is important  that  Member  States  ensure  that  the  requirements  provided  for  in  this  Directive  and  in  Directive  (EU) 2022/2555  are  implemented  in  a  complementary  manner  and  that  critical  entities  are  not  subject  to  an administrative burden beyond that which is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Directive and that Directive.
- (25) Member States should support critical entities, including those that qualify as small or medium-sized enterprises, in strengthening  their  resilience,  in  compliance  with  Member  State  obligations  laid  down  in  this  Directive,  without prejudice  to  the  critical  entities'  own  legal  responsibility  to  ensure  such  compliance  and,  in  so  doing,  prevent excessive administrative burden. Member States could, in particular, develop guidance materials and methodologies, support the organisation of exercises to test the resilience of critical entities and provide advice and training to the personnel  of  critical  entities.  Where  necessary  and  justified  by  public  interest  objectives,  Member  States  could provide financial resources and should facilitate voluntary information sharing and the exchange of good practices between critical entities,  without  prejudice  to the  application  of  competition rules  laid  down in  the  Treaty on  the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
- (26) With the aim of enhancing the resilience of critical entities identified by Member States and in order to reduce the administrative  burden  on  those  critical  entities,  the  competent  authorities  should  consult  one  another,  whenever appropriate, for  the purpose of ensuring that this Directive is applied in a consistent manner. Those consultations should  be  entered  into  at  the  request  of  any  interested  competent  authority  and  should  focus  on  ensuring  a convergent  approach  regarding  interlinked  critical  entities  that  use  critical  infrastructure  which  is  physically connected between two or  more  Member States, that belong  to the  same  groups  or  corporate structures,  or  that have been identified in one Member State and that provide essential services to or in other Member States.
- (27) Where provisions of Union or national law require critical entities to assess risks relevant for  the purposes of  this Directive and to take measures to ensure their own resilience, those requirements should be adequately considered for the purpose of supervising the compliance of critical entities with this Directive.
- (28) Critical entities should have a comprehensive understanding of the relevant risks to which they are exposed and a duty to analyse those risks. To that end, they should carry out risk assessments whenever necessary in view of their particular circumstances and the evolution of those risks and, in any event, every four years, in order  to assess all relevant  risks  that  could  disrupt  the  provision  of  their  essential  services  ('critical  entity  risk  assessment').  Where critical entities have carried out other risk assessments or drawn up documents pursuant to obligations laid down in other legal acts that are relevant for their critical entity risk assessment, they should be able to use those assessments and  documents  to  meet  the  requirements  set  out  in  this  Directive  concerning  critical  entity  risk  assessments.  A competent authority should be able to declare that an existing risk assessment carried out by a critical entity that addresses  the  relevant  risks  and  the  relevant  extent  of  dependence  is  compliant,  in  whole  or  in  part,  with  the obligations laid down in this Directive. - (29) Critical entities should take technical, security and organisational measures that are appropriate and proportionate to the risks they face so as to prevent, protect against, respond to, resist, mitigate, absorb, accommodate and recover from  an  incident.  While  critical  entities  should  take  those  measures  in  accordance  with  this  Directive,  the  details and  extent  of  such  measures  should  reflect  the  different  risks  that  each  critical  entity  has  identified  as  part  of  its critical  entity  risk  assessment  and  the  specificities  of  such  entity  in  an  appropriate  and  proportionate  way.  To promote  a  coherent  Union  approach,  the  Commission  should,  after  consulting  the  Critical  Entities  Resilience Group,  adopt  non-binding  guidelines  to  further  specify  those  technical,  security  and  organisational  measures. Member States  should  ensure  that  each  critical  entity  designate  a  liaison  officer  or  equivalent  as  point  of  contact with the competent authorities.
- (30) In  the  interests  of  effectiveness  and  accountability,  critical  entities  should  describe  the  measures  they  take,  with  a level  of  detail  that  sufficiently  achieves  the  aims  of  effectiveness  and  accountability,  having  regard  to  the  risks identified, in a resilience plan or in a document or documents that are equivalent to a resilience plan, and apply that plan in practice. Where a critical entity has already taken technical, security and organisational measures and drawn up documents pursuant to other legal acts that are relevant for resilience-enhancing measures under this Directive, it should  be  able,  in  order  to  avoid  duplication,  to  use  those  measures  and  documents  to  meet  the  requirements  as regards resilience measures under this Directive. In order to avoid duplication, a competent authority should be able to declare existing resilience measures taken by a critical entity that address its obligation to take technical, security and organisational measures pursuant to this Directive as compliant, in whole or in part, with the requirements of this Directive.
- (31) Regulations (EC) No 725/2004 ( 14 ) and (EC) No 300/2008 ( 15 ) of  the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive  2005/65/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council ( 16 ) establish  requirements  applicable  to entities in the aviation and maritime transport sectors to prevent incidents caused by unlawful acts and to resist and mitigate the consequences of such incidents. While the measures required under this Directive are broader in terms of  risks  addressed  and  types  of  measures  to  be  taken,  critical  entities  in  those  sectors  should  reflect  in  their resilience  plan  or  equivalent  documents  the  measures  taken  pursuant  to  those  other  Union  legal  acts.  Critical entities are also to take into consideration Directive 2008/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 17 ), which introduces a network-wide road assessment to map the risk of accidents and a targeted road safety inspection to identify hazardous conditions, defects and problems that increase the risk of accidents and injuries, based on site visits of existing roads or sections of roads. Ensuring the protection and resilience of critical entities is of the utmost importance for the railway sector and, when implementing resilience measures under this Directive, critical entities are  encouraged  to  refer  to  non-binding  guidelines  and  good  practices  documents  developed  under  sectorial workstreams, such as the EU Rail Passenger Security Platform set up by Commission Decision 2018/C 232/03 ( 18 ).
- (32) The risk of employees  of  critical  entities  or  their  contractors  misusing,  for  instance,  their  access  rights  within  the critical  entity's  organisation  to  harm  and  cause  damage  is  of  increasing  concern.  Member  States  should  therefore specify  the  conditions  under  which  critical  entities  are  permitted,  in  duly  reasoned  cases  and  taking  into  account Member  State  risk  assessments,  to  submit  requests  for  background  checks  on  persons  falling  within  specific categories  of  its  personnel.  It  should  be  ensured  that  the  relevant  authorities  assess  such  requests  within  a reasonable  timeframe  and  process  them  in  accordance  with  national  law  and  procedures  and  relevant  and applicable Union law, including on the protection of personal data. In order to corroborate the identity of a person who is the subject of a background check, it is appropriate for Member States to require proof of identity, such as a passport, a national identity card or a digital form of identification, in accordance with applicable law.
