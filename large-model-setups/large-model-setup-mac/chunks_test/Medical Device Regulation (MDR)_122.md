## . Final review
The notified body shall prior  to making a final decision:
- -  ensure  that the personnel assigned for the final review  and decision-making  on  specific projects are appropriately authorised and are different from the personnel who have conducted the assessments,
- -  verify  that  the  report  or  reports  and  supporting  documentation  needed  for  decision  making,  including concerning  resolution  of  non-conformities  noted  during  assessment,  are  complete  and  sufficient  with  respect to the scope of the application, and
- -  verify whether there are any unresolved non-conformities preventing issuance of a certificate.
## . Decisions and Certifications
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  for  decision-making  including  as  regards  the  allocation  of responsibilities  for  the  issuance,  suspension,  restriction  and  withdrawal  of  certificates.  Those  procedures  shall include  the  notification  requirements  laid  down  in  Chapter  V of  this  Regulation.  The  procedures  shall  allow  the notified body in question to:
- -  decide, based on the assessment documentation and additional information available, whether the requirements of this Regulation are fulfilled,
- -  decide,  based  on  the  results  of  its  assessment  of  the  clinical  evaluation  and  risk  management,  whether  the post-market surveillance plan, including the PMCF plan, is adequate,
- -  decide on specific milestones for further review by the notified body of the up to date clinical evaluation,
- -  decide whether specific conditions or provisions need to be defined for the certification,
- -  decide,  based  on  the  novelty,  risk  classification,  clinical  evaluation  and  conclusions  from  the  risk  analysis  of the device, on a period of certification not exceeding five years,
- -  clearly  document  decision  making  and  approval  steps  including  approval  by  signature  of  the  members  of personnel responsible,
- -  clearly  document  responsibilities  and  mechanisms  for  communication  of  decisions,  in  particular,  where  the final  signatory  of  a  certificate  differs  from  the  decision  maker  or  decision  makers  or  does  not  fulfil  the requirements laid down in Section ,
- -  issue  a  certificate  or  certificates  in  accordance  with  the  minimum  requirements  laid  down  in  Annex  XII  for a  period  of  validity  not  exceeding  five  years  and  shall  indicate  whether  there  are  specific  conditions  or limitations associated with the certification,
- -  issue  a  certificate  or  certificates  for  the  applicant  alone  and  shall  not  issue  certificates  covering  multiple entities, and
- -  ensure that the manufacturer  is notified of  the outcome of  the assessment and the resultant decision and that they are entered into the electronic system referred to in Article 57.
## . Changes and modifications
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  and  contractual  arrangements  with  manufacturers  in  place relating to the manufacturers' information obligations and the assessment of changes to:
- -  the approved quality management system or systems or to the product-range covered,
- -  the approved design of a device,
- -  the intended use of or claims made for the device,
- -  the approved type of a device, and
- -  any  substance  incorporated  in  or  utilised  for  the  manufacturing  of  a  device  and  being  subject  to  the  specific procedures in accordance with Section .
The  procedures  and  contractual  arrangements  referred  to  in  the  first  paragraph  shall  include  measures  for checking the significance of the changes referred to in the first paragraph.
In accordance with its documented procedures, the notified body in question shall:
- -  ensure that manufacturers submit for prior approval plans for changes as referred to in the first paragraph and relevant information relating to such changes,
- -  assess  the  changes  proposed  and  verify  whether,  after  these  changes,  the  quality  management  system,  or  the design of a device or  type of a device, still meets the requirements of this Regulation, and
- -  notify  the  manufacturer  of  its  decision  and  provide  a  report  or  as  applicable  a  supplementary  report,  which shall contain the justified conclusions of its assessment.
## .   Surveillance activities and post-certification monitoring
The notified body shall have documented procedures:
- -  defining  how  and  when  surveillance  activities  of  manufacturers  are  to  be  conducted.  Those  procedures  shall include  arrangements  for  unannounced  on-site  audits  of  manufacturers  and,  where  applicable,  subcontractors and  suppliers  carrying  out  product  tests  and  the  monitoring  of  compliance  with  any  conditions  binding manufacturers and associated with certification decisions, such as updates to clinical data at defined intervals,
- -  for screening relevant sources of scientific  and  clinical data  and post-market information relating to the scope of  their  designation. Such information shall be taken into account in the planning and conduct of surveillance activities, and
- -  to review  vigilance  data  to which  they  have  access  under  Article  92(2)  in  order  to  estimate  its  impact,  if  any, on  the  validity  of existing certificates. The  results of the  evaluation  and  any  decisions  taken  shall  be thoroughly documented.
The  notified  body  in  question  shall,  upon  receipt  of  information  about  vigilance  cases  from  a  manufacturer  or competent authorities, decide which of the following options to apply:
- -  not to take action on the basis that the vigilance case is clearly not related to the certification granted,
- - observe  the  manufacturer's  and  competent  authority's  activities  and  the  results  of  the  manufacturer's  investiÂ­ gation  so  as  to  determine  whether  the  certification  granted  is  at  risk  or  whether  adequate  corrective  action has been taken,
- -  perform  extraordinary  surveillance  measures,  such  as  document  reviews,  short-notice  or  unannounced  audits and product testing, where it is likely that the certification granted is at risk,
- -  increase the frequency of surveillance audits,
- -  review specific products or processes on the occasion of the next audit of the manufacturer, or
- -  take any other relevant measure.
