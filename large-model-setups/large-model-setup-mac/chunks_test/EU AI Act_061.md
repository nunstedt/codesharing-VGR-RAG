The standardisation request shall also ask for deliverables on reporting and documentation processes to improve AI systems' resource performance, such as reducing  the  high-risk  AI  system's  consumption  of  energy  and  of  other  resources  during  its  lifecycle,  and  on  the energy-efficient  development  of  general-purpose  AI  models.  When  preparing  a  standardisation  request,  the  Commission shall  consult  the  Board  and  relevant  stakeholders,  including  the  advisory  forum.
When  issuing  a  standardisation  request  to  European  standardisation  organisations,  the  Commission  shall  specify  that standards have to be clear, consistent, including with the standards developed in the various sectors for products covered by the  existing  Union  harmonisation  legislation  listed  in  Annex  I,  and  aiming  to  ensure  that  high-risk  AI  systems  or general-purpose  AI  models  placed  on  the  market  or  put  into  service  in  the  Union  meet  the  relevant  requirements  or obligations  laid  down  in  this  Regulation.
The Commission shall request the European standardisation organisations to provide evidence of their best efforts to fulfil the  objectives  referred  to  in  the  first  and  the  second  subparagraph  of  this  paragraph  in  accordance  with  Article  24  of Regulation  (EU)  No  1025/2012.
- 3. The  participants  in  the  standardisation  process  shall  seek  to  promote  investment  and  innovation  in  AI,  including through  increasing  legal  certainty,  as  well  as  the  competitiveness  and  growth  of  the  Union  market,  to  contribute  to strengthening global cooperation on standardisation and taking into account existing international standards in the field of AI  that  are  consistent  with  Union values,  fundamental  rights  and  interests,  and  to  enhance  multi-stakeholder  governance ensuring a balanced representation of interests and the effective participation of all relevant stakeholders in accordance with Articles  5,  6,  and  7  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  1025/2012.
