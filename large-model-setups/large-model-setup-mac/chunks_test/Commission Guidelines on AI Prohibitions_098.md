The microphone then collects the biometric sample.
- - A gait recognition system may be used via CCTV and the videos are automatically checked for matches with previously captured templates.
- -  Keystroke  biometric  technology  may  be  used  to  identify  the  person  typing  a fraudulent message.
The fact that these systems are given as examples of RBI systems does not imply that they are prohibited under Article 5 AI Act.
(308) In the case of body-cams capable of RBI used by individual law enforcement agents, the  untargeted  filming  during,  for  example,  a  demonstration  with  hundreds  of participants will be considered to fulfil the condition of remoteness.
## c) Reference database
(309) Identification is not possible without a reference database containing biometric data for comparison purposes. Thus, the existence of a reference database is indispensable to perform the comparison for identification purposes. 189
For example, in the case of missing persons, the Schengen Information System 190 database could be used as the reference database for facial recognition purposes (once operational).
## . Real-time
(310) Real-time  means  that  the  system  captures  and  further  processes  biometric  data 'instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without any significant delay.' 191 All the processing steps, i.e. the capture, comparison, and identification of biometric data,  occur  simultaneously  or  almost  simultaneously,  which  may  include  a  'limited short delay' to avoid the prohibition being circumvented through the retrospective use of RBI systems. 192 The notion of 'without a significant delay' is not defined in the AI Act; it will have to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.  As the devices used for realtime  or  post-remote  identification  are  increasingly  one  and  the  same  with  different

functionalities, the distinction is temporal. Generally speaking, a delay is significant at least when the person is likely to have left the place where the biometric data was taken.
(311) Real-time systems in general are used at a given place to facilitate a quick reaction and not to retrospectively identify persons. They provide the user of the system with a means to track the movements of persons under surveillance and to monitor them.
- a) An AI system screens all incoming visitors to a concert venue: Real-time RBI
- b) A  system  films  all  incoming  visitors  to  a  concert.  An  incident  happens  at  the concert. After the concert, the identification system is operated on the video material in order to identify the offender: Post-RBI.
- (312) When a law enforcement authority covertly takes a picture of a person via a mobile device  and  submits  it  to  a  database  for  immediate  search,  depending  on  the circumstances, this may fall under the prohibition of Article 5(1)(h) AI Act.
## . In publicly accessible spaces .
## (313) Article 3(44) AI Act defines publicly accessible spaces as
any publicly or privately owned physical space accessible to an undetermined number of natural persons, regardless of whether certain conditions for access may apply, and regardless of the potential capacity restrictions.
(314) Recital 19 AI Act lists several elements that characterise such spaces:
- -Accessibility to an undetermined number of persons, independently of the potential capacity or security restrictions, such as purchasing a ticket or title of transport, prior registration or having a certain age. The possibility of getting access to a space through an unlocked door does not mean that the space is publicly accessible if indications or circumstances suggest the contrary (such as a sign restricting access). Moreover, the access to a space can be limited to certain persons, as defined by law, linked  to  public  safety  or  security,  or  to  the  decision  of  the  person  having  the relevant authority over the space.
For example, publicly accessible spaces are in principle:
- -a concert venue for which participants pay an entrance fee.
- -an event location where a trade fair is organised targeting participants over the age of 50.
A space closed by a gate, even if the gate is unlocked, such as the gated entrance of a fenced residential area of several houses, will normally not be considered a publicly accessible space. By contrast, a park in a gated residence with public opening hours without any access restrictions during those hours will generally constitute a publicly accessible space during those hours and a closed space outside those hours.
- -Irrelevance of ownership, i.e. a space does not need to be in public ownership for it to be considered as a publicly accessible space.
For example, the space may be owned by a private entity, a public entity, or a public entity and managed by a private party, without impacting the nature of the space.
- -No specific activity for which the space is used; a publicly accessible area is not necessarily a space linked to a public service. Moreover, a space linked to a public service  may  include  non-publicly  accessible  spaces,  i.e.  the  offices  of  the  civil servants working at a municipality.
For example, publicly accessible spaces may be used for commerce, such as shops, restaurants, caf√©s, etc.; for services, such as banks, professional activities (a doctor's office as well as an accountant's office), hospitality (e.g.
