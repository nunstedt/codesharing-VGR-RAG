## Article 21
## Cybersecurity risk-management measures
- 1. Member  States  shall  ensure  that  essential  and  important  entities  take  appropriate  and  proportionate  technical, operational  and  organisational  measures  to  manage  the  risks  posed  to  the  security of  network  and  information  systems which those entities use for their operations or for the provision of their services, and to prevent or minimise the impact of incidents on recipients of their services and on other services.
Taking into account the state-of-the-art and, where applicable, relevant European and international standards, as well as the cost of implementation, the measures referred to in the first subparagraph shall ensure a level of security of network and information systems appropriate to the risks  posed. When assessing the proportionality of  those measures, due account shall be taken of the degree of the entity's exposure to risks, the entity's size and the likelihood of occurrence of incidents and their severity, including their societal and economic impact.
- 2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on an all-hazards approach that aims to protect network and information systems and the physical environment of those systems from incidents, and shall include at least the following:
- (a) policies on risk analysis and information system security;
- (b) incident handling;
- (c) business continuity, such as backup management and disaster recovery, and crisis management;
- (d) supply chain security, including security-related aspects concerning the relationships between each entity and its direct suppliers or service providers;
- (e) security  in  network  and  information  systems  acquisition,  development  and  maintenance,  including  vulnerability handling and disclosure;
- (f) policies and procedures to assess the effectiveness of cybersecurity risk-management measures;
- (g) basic cyber hygiene practices and cybersecurity training;
- (h) policies and procedures regarding the use of cryptography and, where appropriate, encryption;
- (i) human resources security, access control policies and asset management;
- (j) the use of multi-factor authentication or continuous  authentication  solutions, secured voice, video and  text communications and secured emergency communication systems within the entity, where appropriate.
- 3. Member  States  shall  ensure  that,  when  considering  which  measures  referred  to  in  paragraph  2,  point  (d),  of  this Article  are  appropriate,  entities  take  into  account  the  vulnerabilities  specific  to  each  direct  supplier  and  service  provider and  the  overall  quality  of  products  and  cybersecurity  practices  of  their  suppliers  and  service  providers,  including  their secure  development  procedures.  Member  States  shall  also  ensure  that,  when  considering  which  measures  referred  to  in that point are appropriate, entities are required to take into account the results of the coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains carried out in accordance with Article 22(1).
- 4. Member  States  shall  ensure  that  an  entity  that  finds  that  it  does  not  comply  with  the  measures  provided  for  in paragraph 2 takes, without undue delay, all necessary, appropriate and proportionate corrective measures. - 5. By  17  October  2024,  the  Commission  shall  adopt  implementing  acts  laying  down  the  technical  and  the methodological requirements of the measures referred to in paragraph 2 with regard to DNS service providers, TLD name registries, cloud computing service providers, data centre service providers, content delivery network providers, managed service providers, managed security service providers, providers of online market places, of online search engines and of social networking services platforms, and trust service providers.
The Commission may adopt implementing acts laying down the technical and the methodological requirements, as well as sectoral  requirements,  as  necessary,  of  the  measures  referred  to  in  paragraph  2  with  regard  to  essential  and  important entities other than those referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph.
When preparing the implementing acts referred to in the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph, the Commission shall, to the extent possible, follow European and international standards, as well as relevant technical specifications. The Commission shall exchange advice and cooperate with the Cooperation Group and ENISA on the draft implementing acts in accordance with Article 14(4), point (e).
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(2).
## Article 22
## Union level coordinated security risk assessments of critical supply chains
- 1. The Cooperation Group, in cooperation with the Commission and ENISA, may carry out coordinated security risk assessments of specific critical ICT services, ICT systems or ICT products supply chains, taking into account technical and, where relevant, non-technical risk factors.
- 2. The Commission, after consulting the Cooperation Group and ENISA, and, where necessary, relevant stakeholders, shall identify the specific critical ICT services, ICT systems or ICT products that may be subject to the coordinated security risk assessment referred to in paragraph 1.
## Article 23
## Reporting obligations
- 1. Each Member State shall ensure that essential and important entities notify, without undue delay, its CSIRT or, where applicable,  its  competent  authority  in  accordance  with  paragraph  4  of  any  incident  that  has  a  significant  impact  on  the provision of their services as referred to in paragraph 3 (significant incident). Where appropriate, entities concerned shall notify,  without  undue  delay,  the  recipients  of  their  services  of  significant  incidents  that  are  likely  to  adversely  affect  the provision of those services. Each Member State shall ensure that those entities report, inter alia, any information enabling the CSIRT or, where applicable, the competent authority to determine any cross-border impact of the incident. The mere act of notification shall not subject the notifying entity to increased liability.
Where the  entities  concerned  notify  the  competent  authority  of  a  significant  incident  under  the  first  subparagraph,  the Member State shall ensure that that competent authority forwards the notification to the CSIRT upon receipt.
In  the  case  of  a  cross-border  or  cross-sectoral  significant  incident,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  their  single  points  of contact are provided in due time with relevant information notified in accordance with paragraph 4.
- 2. Where  applicable,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that  essential  and  important  entities  communicate,  without  undue delay, to the recipients of their services that are potentially affected by a significant cyber threat any measures or remedies that  those  recipients  are  able  to  take  in  response  to  that  threat.  Where  appropriate,  the  entities  shall  also  inform  those recipients of the significant cyber threat itself. - 3. An incident shall be considered to be significant if:
- (a) it  has  caused  or  is  capable  of  causing  severe  operational  disruption  of  the  services  or  financial  loss  for  the  entity concerned;
- (b) it has affected or is capable of affecting other natural or legal persons by causing considerable material or non-material damage.
- 4. Member States shall ensure that, for the purpose of notification under paragraph 1, the entities concerned submit to the CSIRT or, where applicable, the competent authority:
- (a) without undue delay and in any event within 24 hours of becoming aware of the significant incident, an early warning, which, where  applicable,  shall  indicate  whether  the  significant  incident  is  suspected  of  being  caused  by  unlawful  or malicious acts or could have a cross-border impact;
- (b) without  undue  delay  and  in  any  event  within  72  hours  of  becoming  aware  of  the  significant  incident,  an  incident notification,  which,  where  applicable,  shall  update  the  information  referred  to  in  point  (a)  and  indicate  an  initial assessment of  the significant  incident, including its severity and impact, as well as, where available, the indicators of compromise;
- (c) upon the request of a CSIRT or, where applicable, the competent authority, an intermediate report on relevant status updates;
- (d) a final report not later than one month after the submission of the incident notification under point (b), including the following:
- (i) a detailed description of the incident, including its severity and impact;
- (ii) the type of threat or root cause that is likely to have triggered the incident;
- (iii) applied and ongoing mitigation measures;
- (iv) where applicable, the cross-border impact of the incident;
- (e) in the event of an ongoing incident at the time of the submission of the final report referred to in point (d), Member States shall ensure that entities concerned provide a progress report at that time and a final report within one month of their handling of the incident.
By  way  of  derogation  from  the  first  subparagraph,  point  (b),  a  trust  service  provider  shall,  with  regard  to  significant incidents that have an impact on the provision of its trust services, notify the CSIRT or, where applicable, the competent authority, without undue delay and in any event within 24 hours of becoming aware of the significant incident.
- 5. The CSIRT or  the  competent  authority  shall  provide,  without  undue  delay  and  where  possible  within  24  hours  of receiving  the  early  warning  referred  to  in  paragraph  4,  point  (a),  a  response  to  the  notifying  entity,  including  initial feedback on the significant incident and, upon request of the entity, guidance or operational advice on the implementation of possible mitigation measures. Where the CSIRT is not the initial recipient of the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the  guidance  shall  be  provided  by  the  competent  authority  in  cooperation  with  the  CSIRT.  The  CSIRT  shall  provide additional  technical  support  if  the  entity  concerned  so  requests.  Where  the  significant  incident  is  suspected  to  be  of criminal nature, the CSIRT or the competent authority shall also provide guidance on reporting the significant incident to law enforcement authorities.
- 6. Where appropriate, and in particular where the significant incident concerns two or more Member States, the CSIRT, the competent authority or the single point of contact shall inform, without undue delay, the other affected Member States and ENISA of the significant incident. Such information shall include the type of information received in accordance with paragraph  4.  In  so  doing,  the  CSIRT,  the  competent  authority  or  the  single  point  of  contact  shall,  in  accordance  with Union  or  national  law,  preserve  the  entity's  security  and  commercial  interests  as  well  as  the  confidentiality  of  the information provided. - 7. Where public awareness is necessary to prevent a significant incident or to deal with an ongoing significant incident, or  where  disclosure  of  the  significant  incident  is  otherwise  in  the  public  interest,  a  Member  State's  CSIRT  or,  where applicable,  its  competent  authority,  and,  where  appropriate,  the  CSIRTs  or  the  competent  authorities  of  other  Member States concerned, may, after consulting the entity concerned, inform the public about the significant incident or require the entity to do so.
- 8. At  the  request  of  the  CSIRT  or  the  competent  authority,  the  single  point  of  contact  shall  forward  notifications received pursuant to paragraph 1 to the single points of contact of other affected Member States.
- 9. The single point of contact shall submit to ENISA every three months a summary report, including anonymised and aggregated data on significant incidents, incidents, cyber threats and near misses notified in accordance with paragraph 1 of  this Article and with Article 30. In order  to contribute to the provision of comparable information, ENISA may adopt technical  guidance  on  the  parameters of  the  information  to be  included  in  the  summary  report.  ENISA  shall  inform  the Cooperation Group and the CSIRTs network about its findings on notifications received every six months.
- 10. The  CSIRTs  or,  where  applicable,  the  competent  authorities  shall  provide  to  the  competent  authorities  under Directive  (EU)  2022/2557  information  about  significant  incidents,  incidents,  cyber  threats  and  near  misses  notified  in accordance  with  paragraph  1  of  this  Article  and  with  Article  30  by  entities  identified  as  critical  entities  under Directive (EU) 2022/2557.
- 11. The  Commission  may  adopt  implementing  acts  further  specifying  the  type  of  information,  the  format  and  the procedure of a notification submitted pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article and to Article 30 and of a communication submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article.
- By 17 October 2024, the Commission shall, with regard to DNS service providers, TLD name registries, cloud computing service providers, data centre service providers, content delivery network providers, managed service providers, managed security service providers, as well as providers of online marketplaces, of online search engines and of social networking services  platforms,  adopt  implementing  acts  further  specifying  the  cases  in  which  an  incident  shall  be  considered  to  be significant  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  3.  The  Commission  may  adopt  such  implementing  acts  with  regard  to  other essential and important entities.
The Commission shall exchange advice and cooperate with the Cooperation Group on the draft implementing acts referred to in the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph in accordance with Article 14(4), point (e).
Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 39(2).
## Article 24
## Use of European cybersecurity certification schemes
- 1. In order to demonstrate compliance with particular requirements of Article 21, Member States may require essential and  important  entities  to  use  particular  ICT  products,  ICT  services  and  ICT  processes,  developed  by  the  essential  or important  entity  or  procured  from  third  parties,  that  are  certified  under  European  cybersecurity  certification  schemes adopted pursuant to Article 49 of Regulation (EU) 2019/881. Furthermore, Member States shall encourage essential and important entities to use qualified trust services.
- 2. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, in accordance with Article 38, to supplement this Directive by specifying which categories of essential and important entities are to be required to use certain certified ICT products, ICT  services  and  ICT  processes  or  obtain  a  certificate  under  a  European  cybersecurity  certification  scheme  adopted pursuant  to  Article  49  of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/881.  Those  delegated  acts  shall  be  adopted  where  insufficient  levels  of cybersecurity have been identified and shall include an implementation period.
