For  each  device,  manufacturers  shall  plan,  establish,  document,  implement,  maintain  and  update  a  post-market surveillance  system  in  a  manner  that  is  proportionate  to  the  risk  class  and  appropriate  for  the  type  of  device.  That system shall be an integral part of the manufacturer's quality management system referred to in Article 10(9).
- 2. The  post-market  surveillance  system  shall  be  suited  to  actively and  systematically  gathering,  recording  and analysing  relevant  data  on  the  quality,  performance  and  safety of  a  device  throughout  its  entire  lifetime,  and  to  drawing the necessary conclusions and to determining, implementing and monitoring any preventive and corrective actions.
- 3. Data gathered by the manufacturer's post-market surveillance system shall in particular be used:
- (a)   to update the benefit-risk determination and to improve the risk management as referred to in Chapter I of Annex I;
- (b)   to update the design and manufacturing information, the instructions for use and the labelling;
- (c)   to update the clinical evaluation;
- (d)   to update the summary of safety and clinical performance referred to in Article 32;
- (e)   for  the  identification  of needs for  preventive, corrective or field safety corrective action;
- (f)   for  the identification of options to improve the usability, performance and safety of the device;
- (g)   when relevant, to contribute to the post-market surveillance of other devices; and
- (h)   to detect and report trends in accordance with Article 88.
The technical documentation shall be updated accordingly. - 4. If,  in  the  course  of  the  post-market surveillance, a need for  preventive or corrective action or both is identified, the manufacturer  shall  implement  the  appropriate  measures  and  inform  the  competent  authorities  concerned  and,  where applicable,  the  notified  body.  Where  a  serious  incident  is  identified  or  a  field  safety  corrective  action  is  implemented,  it shall be reported in accordance with Article 87.
## Article 84
## Post-market surveillance plan
The  post-market  surveillance  system  referred  to  in  Article  83  shall  be  based  on  a  post-market  surveillance  plan,  the requirements  for  which  are  set  out  in  Section    of  Annex  III.  For  devices  other  than  custom-made  devices,  the  postmarket surveillance plan shall be part of the technical documentation specified in Annex II.
## Article 85
## Post-market surveillance report
Manufacturers of class I devices shall  prepare a  post-market surveillance  report  summarising the results  and  conclusions of  the  analyses  of  the  post-market  surveillance  data  gathered  as  a  result  of  the  post-market  surveillance  plan  referred  to in  Article  84  together  with  a  rationale  and  description  of  any  preventive  and  corrective  actions  taken.  The  report  shall be updated when necessary and made available to the competent authority upon request.
## Article 86
## Periodic safety update report
- 1. Manufacturers  of  class  IIa,  class  IIb  and  class  III  devices  shall  prepare  a  periodic  safety  update  report  ('PSUR')  for each  device  and  where  relevant  for  each  category  or  group  of  devices  summarising  the  results  and  conclusions  of  the analyses  of  the  post-market  surveillance  data  gathered  as  a  result  of  the  post-market  surveillance  plan  referred  to  in Article  84  together  with  a  rationale  and  description  of  any  preventive  and  corrective  actions  taken.  Throughout  the lifetime of  the device concerned, that PSUR shall set out:
- (a)   the  conclusions of  the benefit-risk determination;
- (b)   the  main findings of  the PMCF; and
- (c)   the  volume  of  sales  of  the  device  and  an  estimate  evaluation  of  the  size  and  other  characteristics  of  the  population using the device and, where practicable, the usage frequency of the device.
Manufacturers  of  class  IIb  and  class  III  devices  shall  update  the  PSUR  at  least  annually.  That  PSUR  shall,  except  in  the case of custom-made devices, be part of the technical documentation as specified in Annexes II and III.
Manufacturers  of  class  IIa  devices  shall  update  the  PSUR  when  necessary  and  at  least  every  two  years.  That  PSUR  shall, except in the case of custom-made devices, be part of the technical documentation as specified in Annexes II and III.
For custom-made devices, the PSUR shall be part of the documentation referred to in Section 2 of Annex XIII.
- 2. For  class  III  devices  or  implantable  devices,  manufacturers  shall  submit  PSURs  by  means  of  the  electronic  system referred  to  in  Article  92  to  the  notified  body  involved  in  the  conformity  assessment  in  accordance  with  Article  52.  The notified  body  shall  review  the  report  and  add  its  evaluation  to  that  electronic  system  with  details  of  any  action  taken. Such  PSURs  and  the  evaluation  by  the  notified  body  shall  be  made  available  to  competent  authorities  through  that electronic system.
- 3. For  devices  other  than  those  referred  to  in  paragraph  2,  manufacturers  shall  make  PSURs  available  to  the  notified body involved in the conformity assessment and, upon request, to competent authorities. SECTION 2
## Vigilance
Article 87
## Reporting of serious incidents and field safety corrective actions
- 1. Manufacturers  of  devices  made  available  on  the  Union  market,  other  than  investigational  devices,  shall  report,  to the relevant competent authorities, in accordance with Articles 92(5) and (7), the following:
- (a)   any  serious  incident  involving  devices  made  available  on  the  Union  market,  except  expected  side-effects  which  are clearly  documented  in  the  product  information  and  quantified  in  the  technical  documentation  and  are  subject  to trend reporting pursuant to Article 88;
- (b)   any field  safety corrective  action  in  respect of  devices  made  available on  the  Union  market,  including any  field safety corrective  action  undertaken  in  a  third  country  in  relation  to  a  device  which  is  also  legally  made  available  on  the Union  market,  if  the  reason  for  the  field  safety  corrective  action  is  not  limited  to  the  device  made  available  in  the third country.
The  reports  referred  to  in  the  first  subparagraph  shall  be  submitted  through  the  electronic  system  referred  to  in Article 92.
- 2. As  a  general  rule,  the  period  for  the  reporting  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  shall  take  account  of  the  severity  of  the serious incident.
- 3. Manufacturers  shall  report  any  serious  incident  as  referred  to  in  point  (a)  of  paragraph  1  immediately  after  they have  established  the  causal  relationship  between  that  incident  and  their  device  or  that  such  causal  relationship  is reasonably possible and not later than 15 days after they become aware of the incident.
