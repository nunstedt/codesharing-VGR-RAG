THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the  Functioning  of  the  European  Union, and  in particular  Articles  16  and  114  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal  from the  European Commission,
After  transmission  of  the  draft  legislative  act  to  the  national  parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of  the European  Economic and Social Committee ( 1 ),
Having regard to the opinion of  the European  Central  Bank ( 2 ),
Having regard to the opinion of  the Committee of  the Regions ( 3 ),
Acting  in  accordance  with  the  ordinary  legislative  procedure ( 4 ),
## Whereas:
- (1) The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market by laying down a uniform legal framework  in  particular  for  the  development,  the  placing  on  the  market,  the  putting  into  service  and  the  use  of artificial intelligence systems (AI systems) in the Union, in accordance with Union values, to promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental  rights  as  enshrined  in  the  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the  European  Union  (the  'Charter'), including  democracy,  the  rule  of  law  and  environmental  protection,  to  protect  against  the  harmful  effects  of  AI systems  in  the  Union,  and  to  support  innovation.  This  Regulation  ensures  the  free  movement,  cross-border,  of AI-based  goods  and  services,  thus  preventing  Member  States  from  imposing  restrictions  on  the  development, marketing and use of AI systems, unless  explicitly  authorised  by this  Regulation.
- (2) This Regulation should be applied in accordance with the values of the Union enshrined as in the Charter, facilitating the  protection  of  natural  persons,  undertakings,  democracy,  the  rule  of  law  and  environmental  protection,  while boosting innovation and employment and making the Union a leader  in the uptake of  trustworthy AI.
- (3) AI systems can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and many parts of society, including across  borders,  and  can  easily  circulate  throughout  the  Union.  Certain  Member  States  have  already  explored  the adoption of national rules to ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of  the internal market and may decrease  legal  certainty  for  operators  that  develop,  import  or  use  AI  systems.
