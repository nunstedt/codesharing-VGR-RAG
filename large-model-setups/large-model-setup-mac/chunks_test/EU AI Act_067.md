Prospective  providers  in  the  AI  regulatory  sandboxes,  in  particular  SMEs  and  start-ups,  shall  be  directed,  where relevant,  to  pre-deployment  services  such  as  guidance  on  the  implementation  of  this  Regulation,  to  other  value-adding services  such  as  help  with  standardisation  documents  and  certification,  testing  and  experimentation  facilities,  European Digital  Innovation  Hubs  and  centres  of  excellence.
- 4. Where  national  competent  authorities  consider  authorising  testing  in  real  world  conditions  supervised  within  the framework  of  an  AI  regulatory  sandbox  to  be  established  under  this  Article,  they  shall  specifically  agree  the  terms  and conditions  of  such  testing  and,  in  particular,  the  appropriate  safeguards  with  the  participants,  with  a  view  to  protecting fundamental rights, health and safety. Where appropriate, they shall cooperate with other  national competent authorities with  a  view  to  ensuring  consistent  practices  across  the  Union.
## Article  59
## Further processing of personal data for developing certain AI systems in the public interest in the AI regulatory sandbox
- 1. In  the  AI  regulatory  sandbox,  personal  data  lawfully  collected  for  other  purposes  may  be  processed  solely  for  the purpose of developing, training and testing certain AI systems in the sandbox when all of the following conditions are met:
- (a) AI  systems  shall  be  developed  for  safeguarding  substantial  public  interest  by  a  public  authority or  another  natural  or legal  person  and  in  one  or  more  of  the  following  areas:
- (i) public  safety  and  public  health,  including  disease  detection,  diagnosis  prevention,  control  and  treatment  and improvement of health care systems;
- (ii) a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, protection of biodiversity, protection against  pollution,  green  transition  measures,  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation  measures;
- (iii) energy sustainability;
- (iv) safety  and  resilience  of  transport  systems  and  mobility,  critical  infrastructure  and  networks;
- (v) efficiency  and  quality of  public  administration  and  public  services;
- (b) the  data  processed  are  necessary  for  complying  with  one  or  more  of  the  requirements  referred  to  in  Chapter  III, Section  2  where  those  requirements  cannot  effectively  be  fulfilled  by  processing  anonymised,  synthetic  or  other non-personal data;
- (c) there are effective monitoring mechanisms to identify if any high risks to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects, as referred  to  in  Article  35  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679  and  in  Article  39  of  Regulation  (EU)  2018/1725,  may  arise during  the  sandbox  experimentation,  as  well  as  response  mechanisms  to  promptly  mitigate  those  risks  and,  where necessary,  stop the  processing;
- (d) any personal data to be processed in the context of  the sandbox are in a functionally separate, isolated and protected data processing environment under the control of the prospective provider and only authorised persons have access to those  data;
- (e) providers  can  further  share  the  originally  collected  data  only  in  accordance  with  Union  data  protection  law;  any personal  data  created  in  the  sandbox  cannot  be  shared  outside  the  sandbox;
- (f) any processing of personal data in the context of the sandbox neither leads to measures or decisions affecting the data subjects  nor  does  it  affect  the  application  of  their  rights  laid  down  in  Union  law  on  the  protection  of  personal  data;
- (g) any  personal  data  processed  in  the  context  of  the  sandbox  are  protected  by  means  of  appropriate  technical  and organisational  measures  and  deleted  once  the  participation  in  the  sandbox  has  terminated  or  the  personal  data  has reached  the  end  of  its  retention  period;
- (h) the logs of the processing of personal data in the context of the sandbox are kept for the duration of the participation in the  sandbox,  unless  provided  otherwise  by  Union  or  national  law;
- (i) a  complete  and  detailed  description  of  the  process  and  rationale  behind  the  training,  testing  and  validation  of  the  AI system  is  kept  together  with  the  testing  results  as  part  of  the  technical  documentation  referred  to  in  Annex  IV;
- (j) a  short  summary of  the  AI  project  developed  in  the  sandbox,  its  objectives  and  expected  results  is  published  on  the website of the competent authorities; this obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data in relation to the activities of  law  enforcement,  border  control,  immigration  or  asylum  authorities.
- 2. For  the  purposes of  the  prevention,  investigation, detection or  prosecution  of criminal offences  or  the execution of criminal  penalties,  including  safeguarding  against  and  preventing  threats  to  public  security,  under  the  control  and responsibility of  law enforcement authorities, the processing of personal data in AI regulatory sandboxes shall be based on a  specific  Union  or  national  law  and  subject  to  the  same  cumulative  conditions  as  referred  to  in  paragraph  1.
- 3. Paragraph  1  is  without  prejudice  to  Union  or  national  law  which  excludes  processing  of  personal  data  for  other purposes  than  those  explicitly  mentioned  in  that  law,  as  well  as  to  Union  or  national  law  laying  down  the  basis  for  the processing of personal data which is necessary for the purpose of developing, testing or training of innovative AI systems or any other legal  basis,  in  compliance  with  Union  law  on  the  protection  of  personal  data.
