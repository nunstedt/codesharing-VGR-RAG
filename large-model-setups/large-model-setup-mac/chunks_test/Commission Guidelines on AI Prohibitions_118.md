## For example,
- -  A  French  administrative  Court  found  that  the  trial  of  live  facial  recognition technology  in  two  public  schools  for  access  control  and  security  purposes  was neither  necessary  nor  proportionate  (under  data  protection  rules).  Alternative solutions that were less  intrusive for the students were available, e.g. the use of badges. In addition, the conditions for explicit consent were not met. Therefore, consent could not be used as a valid legal basis to trial facial recognition technology in high schools. 239
- - A supermarket was not allowed to use live facial recognition technology to prevent shoplifting in the Netherlands. Without explicit consent from the customer or any legal basis allowing the processing for a substantial public interest (such as security purposes), the supermarket could not process biometric data and thus deploy facial recognition technology. 240
- - The use of live facial recognition technology at the entrance of a football club to identify supporters was prohibited in France 241 and to ensure the safety of spectators was prohibited in Spain. 242
## . Examples of uses
The police instals mobile CCTV cameras equipped with AI-based facial recognition technologies on a police van around the main entrance of a football stadium during a European Championship match to secure the area and identify individuals whose faces  are  recorded  in  an  ad  hoc  watchlist  database  of  wanted  individuals.
