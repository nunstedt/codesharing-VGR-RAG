This Directive shall not apply to matters covered by Directive (EU) 2022/2555, without prejudice to Article 8 of this Directive. In light of the relationship between the physical security and cybersecurity of critical entities, Member States shall ensure that this Directive and Directive (EU) 2022/2555 are implemented in a coordinated manner.
- 3. Where  provisions  of  sector-specific  Union  legal  acts  require  critical  entities  to  take  measures  to  enhance  their resilience  and  where  those  requirements  are  recognised  by  Member  States  as  at  least  equivalent  to  the  corresponding obligations laid  down in this  Directive,  the relevant  provisions  of  this  Directive,  including  the  provisions  on  supervision and enforcement laid down in Chapter VI, shall not apply.
