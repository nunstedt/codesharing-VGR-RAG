The OpPlan system is designed to manage the scheduling of planned surgeries within primary care settings, covering the entire process from initial request to completion. Its primary users are medical specialists. Given its function, OpPlan processes sensitive data, specifically personal and health-related information. The system is hosted on-premise and is accessible only via the internal network, ensuring restricted access. Notably, OpPlan does not incorporate any artificial intelligence (AI) components or systems. Its criticality is assessed as 'Medium,' indicating that its operational impact, should it experience issues, would be significant.
