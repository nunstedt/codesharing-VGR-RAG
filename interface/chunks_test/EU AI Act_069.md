- 2. Providers or prospective providers may conduct testing of high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III in real world conditions  at  any  time  before  the  placing  on  the  market  or  the  putting  into  service  of  the  AI  system  on  their  own  or  in partnership  with  one  or  more  deployers  or  prospective  deployers.
- 3. The testing of high-risk AI systems in real world conditions under this Article shall be without prejudice to any ethical review  that  is  required  by  Union  or  national  law.
- 4. Providers or  prospective providers may conduct the testing in real world conditions only where all of  the following conditions  are  met:
- (a) the provider or prospective provider has drawn up a real-world testing plan and submitted it to the market surveillance authority  in  the  Member  State  where  the  testing  in  real  world  conditions  is  to  be  conducted;
- (b) the market surveillance authority in the Member State where the testing in real world conditions is to be conducted has approved the testing in real world conditions and the real-world testing plan; where the market surveillance authority has not provided an answer within 30 days, the testing in real world conditions and the real-world testing plan shall be understood to have been approved; where national law does not provide for a tacit approval, the testing in real world conditions  shall  remain  subject  to  an  authorisation;
- (c) the provider or prospective provider, with the exception of providers or prospective providers of high-risk AI systems referred  to  in  points  1,  6  and  7  of  Annex  III  in  the  areas  of  law  enforcement,  migration,  asylum  and  border  control management,  and  high-risk  AI  systems  referred  to  in  point  2  of  Annex  III  has  registered  the  testing  in  real  world conditions  in  accordance  with  Article  71(4)  with  a  Union-wide  unique  single  identification  number  and  with  the information specified in Annex IX; the provider or prospective provider of high-risk AI systems referred to in points 1, 6 and 7 of Annex III in the areas of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, has registered the testing in real-world conditions in the secure non-public section of the EU database according to Article 49(4), point (d), with a Union-wide unique single identification number and with the information specified therein; the provider or prospective provider of high-risk AI systems referred to in point 2 of Annex III has registered the testing in real-world conditions  in  accordance  with  Article  49(5);
- (d) the provider or prospective provider conducting the testing in real world conditions is established in the Union or has appointed a legal representative  who  is  established  in  the  Union;
- (e) data  collected  and  processed  for  the  purpose  of  the  testing  in  real  world  conditions  shall  be  transferred  to  third countries  only  provided  that  appropriate  and  applicable  safeguards  under  Union  law are  implemented;
- (f) the  testing  in  real  world  conditions  does  not  last  longer  than  necessary  to  achieve  its  objectives  and  in  any  case  not longer than six months, which may be extended for an additional period of six months, subject to prior notification by the provider or prospective provider to the market surveillance authority, accompanied by an explanation of the need for  such  an  extension;
- (g) the subjects of the testing in real world conditions who are persons belonging to vulnerable groups due to their age or disability,  are  appropriately  protected;
- (h) where a provider or prospective provider organises the testing in real world conditions in cooperation with one or more deployers or prospective deployers, the latter have been informed of all aspects of the testing that are relevant to their decision  to  participate,  and  given  the  relevant  instructions  for  use  of  the  AI  system  referred  to  in  Article  13;  the provider or prospective provider and the deployer or prospective deployer shall conclude an agreement specifying their roles  and  responsibilities  with  a  view  to  ensuring  compliance  with  the  provisions  for  testing  in  real  world  conditions under  this  Regulation  and  under  other  applicable  Union  and  national  law;
- (i) the subjects of the testing in real world conditions have given informed consent in accordance with Article 61, or in the case  of  law  enforcement,  where the  seeking of  informed consent would prevent the AI system from being tested, the testing  itself  and  the  outcome  of  the  testing  in  the  real  world  conditions  shall  not  have  any  negative  effect  on  the subjects,  and  their  personal  data  shall  be  deleted  after  the  test  is  performed;
- (j) the  testing  in  real  world  conditions  is  effectively  overseen  by  the  provider  or  prospective  provider,  as  well  as  by deployers  or  prospective  deployers  through  persons  who  are  suitably  qualified  in  the  relevant  field  and  have  the necessary capacity,  training  and  authority  to  perform  their  tasks;
- (k) the  predictions,  recommendations  or  decisions  of  the  AI  system  can  be  effectively  reversed  and  disregarded.

In  accordance  with  Article  75,  Member  States  shall  confer  on  their  market  surveillance  authorities  the  powers  of requiring  providers  and  prospective  providers  to  provide  information,  of  carrying  out  unannounced  remote  or  on-site inspections, and of performing checks on the conduct of the testing in real world conditions and the related high-risk AI systems.  Market  surveillance  authorities  shall  use  those  powers  to  ensure  the  safe  development  of  testing  in  real  world conditions.
- 7. Any serious incident identified in the course of the testing in real world conditions shall be reported to the national market surveillance authority in accordance with Article 73. The provider or  prospective provider shall adopt immediate mitigation measures or, failing that, shall suspend the testing in real world conditions until such mitigation takes place, or otherwise  terminate  it.

- 8. Providers or prospective providers shall notify the national market surveillance authority in the Member State where the  testing  in  real  world  conditions  is  to  be  conducted  of  the  suspension  or  termination  of  the  testing  in  real  world conditions  and  of  the  final  outcomes.
- 9. The provider or prospective provider shall be liable under applicable Union and national liability law for any damage caused in  the  course  of  their  testing  in  real  world  conditions.
