## 1. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
- (1) Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 June 2024  laying  down  harmonised  rules  on  artificial  intelligence  and  amending  certain regulations ('the AI Act') 1 entered into force on 1 August 2024. The AI Act lays down harmonised rules for the placing on the market, putting into service, and use of artificial intelligence ('AI') in the Union. 2 Its aim is to promote innovation in and the uptake of AI, while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights in the Union, including democracy and the rule of law.
- (2) The AI Act follows a risk-based approach, classifying AI systems into four different risk categories:
- (i) Unacceptable risk: AI systems posing unacceptable risks to fundamental rights and Union values are prohibited under Article 5 AI Act.
- (ii) High risk: AI systems posing high risks to health, safety and fundamental rights are subject to a set of requirements and obligations. These systems are classified as 'high-risk' in accordance with Article 6 AI Act in conjunction with Annexes I and III AI Act.
- (iii) Transparency  risk:  AI  systems  posing  limited  transparency  risk  are  subject  to transparency obligations under Article 50 AI Act.
- (iv) Minimal to no risk: AI systems posing minimal to no risk are not regulated, but providers and deployers may voluntarily adhere to voluntary codes of conduct. 3
- (3) Pursuant  to  Article  96(1)(b)  AI  Act,  the  Commission  is  to  adopt  guidelines  on  the practical  implementation  of  the  practices  prohibited  under  Article  5  AI  Act.  Those prohibitions apply six months after the entry into force of the AI Act, i.e. as from 2 February 2025.
- (4) These  Guidelines  aim  to  increase  legal  clarity  and  to  provide  insights  into  the Commission's interpretation  of  the  prohibitions  in  Article  5  AI  Act  with  a  view  to ensuring  their  consistent,  effective  and  uniform  application.  They  should  serve  as practical guidance to assist competent authorities under the AI Act in their enforcement activities, as well as providers and deployers of AI systems in ensuring compliance with their  obligations  under  the  AI  Act.  They  strive  to  interpret  the  prohibitions  in  a proportionate manner that achieves the objectives of the AI Act to protect fundamental rights and safety, while promoting innovation and providing legal certainty.
- (5) These Guidelines are non-binding. Any authoritative interpretation of the AI Act may ultimately only be given by the Court of Justice of the European Union ('CJEU').
1 Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) (OJ L, 2024/1689, ).
2 Article 1 AI Act.
3 Article 95 AI Act.
- (6) The drafting of these Guidelines was informed by input from a variety of stakeholders, e.g.,  providers  and  deployers  of  AI  systems,  civil  society  organisations,  academia, public  authorities,  business  associations,  etc.,  collected  during  a  broad  consultation process organised by the Commission. The Member States within the AI Board and the European Parliament were also consulted. These Guidelines will be regularly reviewed in light of the experience gained from the practical implementation of Article 5 AI Act and technological and market developments.
- (7) The application of Article 5 AI Act will require a case-by-case assessment, which takes due  account  of  the  specific  situation  at  issue  in  an  individual  case.  Therefore,  the examples given in these Guidelines are merely indicative and are without prejudice to the need for such an assessment in each case.
