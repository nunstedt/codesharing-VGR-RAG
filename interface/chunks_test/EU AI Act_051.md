It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IV. SMEs, including start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified in Annex IV in a simplified manner. To that end, the Commission shall establish  a  simplified  technical  documentation  form  targeted  at  the  needs  of  small  and  microenterprises.  Where  an  SME, including  a  start-up,  opts  to  provide  the  information  required  in  Annex  IV  in  a  simplified  manner,  it  shall  use  the  form referred  to  in  this  paragraph.  Notified  bodies  shall  accept  the  form  for  the  purposes  of  the  conformity  assessment.
- 2. Where a high-risk  AI  system  related  to  a  product  covered  by  the  Union  harmonisation  legislation  listed  in  Section A  of  Annex  I  is  placed  on  the  market  or  put  into  service,  a  single  set  of  technical  documentation  shall  be  drawn  up containing all  the  information  set  out  in  paragraph  1,  as  well  as  the  information  required  under  those  legal  acts.
- 3. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in order  to amend Annex IV, where  necessary,  to  ensure  that,  in  light  of  technical  progress,  the  technical  documentation  provides  all  the  information necessary  to  assess  the  compliance  of  the  system with  the  requirements  set  out  in  this  Section.

- (c) monitoring  the  operation  of  high-risk  AI  systems  referred  to  in  Article  26(5).
- 3. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1 (a), of Annex III, the logging capabilities shall provide, at a minimum:
- (a) recording  of  the  period  of  each  use  of  the  system  (start  date  and  time  and  end  date  and  time  of  each  use);
- (b) the  reference  database  against  which  input  data  has  been  checked  by  the  system;
- (c) the  input  data  for  which  the  search  has  led  to  a  match;
