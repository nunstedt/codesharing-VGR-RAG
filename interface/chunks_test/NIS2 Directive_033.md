- 2. The report shall include particular policy recommendations, with a view to addressing shortcomings and increasing the  level  of  cybersecurity  across  the  Union,  and  a  summary  of  the  findings  for  the  particular  period  from  the  EU Cybersecurity Technical  Situation  Reports  on  incidents  and  cyber  threats  prepared  by ENISA in  accordance  with  Article 7(6) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881.
- 3. ENISA,  in  cooperation  with  the  Commission,  the  Cooperation  Group  and  the  CSIRTs  network,  shall  develop  the methodology, including the relevant variables, such as quantitative and qualitative indicators, of the aggregated assessment referred to in paragraph 1, point (e).
## Article 19
## Peer reviews
- 1. The Cooperation Group shall, on 17 January 2025, establish, with the assistance of the Commission and ENISA, and, where relevant, the CSIRTs network, the methodology and organisational aspects of peer reviews with a view to learning from shared experiences, strengthening mutual trust, achieving a high common level of cybersecurity, as well as enhancing Member States' cybersecurity capabilities and policies necessary to implement this Directive. Participation in peer reviews is voluntary. The peer reviews shall be carried out by cybersecurity experts. The cybersecurity experts shall be designated by at least two Member States, different from the Member State being reviewed.
The peer reviews shall cover at least one of the following:
- (a) the  level  of  implementation  of  the  cybersecurity  risk-management  measures  and  reporting  obligations  laid  down  in Articles 21 and 23;
- (b) the level of capabilities, including the available financial, technical and human resources, and the effectiveness of  the exercise of the tasks of the competent authorities;
- (c) the operational capabilities of the CSIRTs;
- (d) the level of implementation of mutual assistance referred to in Article 37;
- (e) the level of implementation of the cybersecurity information-sharing arrangements referred to in Article 29;
- (f) specific issues of cross-border or cross-sector nature.
- 2. The methodology referred to in paragraph 1 shall include objective, non-discriminatory, fair and transparent criteria on  the  basis  of  which  the  Member  States  designate  cybersecurity  experts  eligible  to  carry  out  the  peer  reviews.  The Commission and ENISA shall participate as observers in the peer reviews. - 3. Member States may identify specific issues as referred to in paragraph 1, point (f), for the purposes of a peer review.
- 4. Before commencing a peer review as referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall notify the participating Member States of its scope, including the specific issues identified pursuant to paragraph 3.
- 5. Prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  peer  review,  Member  States  may  carry  out  a  self-assessment  of  the  reviewed aspects  and  provide  that  self-assessment  to  the  designated  cybersecurity  experts.  The  Cooperation  Group  shall,  with  the assistance of the Commission and ENISA, lay down the methodology for the Member States' self-assessment.
- 6. Peer  reviews  shall  entail  physical  or  virtual  on-site  visits  and  off-site  exchanges  of  information.  In  line  with  the principle  of  good  cooperation,  the  Member  State  subject  to  the  peer  review  shall  provide  the  designated  cybersecurity experts  with  the  information  necessary  for  the  assessment,  without  prejudice  to  Union  or  national  law  concerning  the protection  of  confidential  or  classified  information  and  to  the  safeguarding  of  essential  State  functions,  such  as  national security.  The  Cooperation  Group,  in  cooperation  with  the  Commission  and  ENISA,  shall  develop  appropriate  codes  of conduct underpinning the working methods of designated cybersecurity experts. Any information obtained through the peer  review  shall  be  used  solely  for  that  purpose.  The  cybersecurity  experts  participating  in  the  peer  review  shall  not disclose any sensitive or confidential information obtained in the course of that peer review to any third parties.
- 7. Once subject to a peer  review, the  same  aspects  reviewed  in  a  Member  State  shall  not  be  subject  to  a  further  peer review in that Member State for two years following the conclusion of the peer review, unless otherwise requested by the Member State or agreed upon after a proposal of the Cooperation Group.
- 8. Member States shall  ensure  that  any  risk  of  conflict  of  interest  concerning  the  designated  cybersecurity  experts  is revealed to the other Member States, the Cooperation Group, the Commission and ENISA, before the commencement of the  peer  review.  The  Member  State  subject  to  the  peer  review  may  object  to  the  designation  of  particular  cybersecurity experts on duly substantiated grounds communicated to the designating Member State.
- 9. Cybersecurity experts  participating  in peer  reviews  shall  draft  reports  on  the  findings  and  conclusions  of  the  peer reviews. Member States subject to a peer  review may provide comments on the draft reports concerning them and such comments  shall  be  attached  to  the  reports.  The  reports  shall  include  recommendations  to  enable  improvement  on  the aspects  covered  by  the  peer  review.  The  reports  shall  be  submitted  to  the  Cooperation  Group  and  the  CSIRTs  network where  relevant.  A  Member  State  subject  to  the  peer  review  may  decide  to  make  its  report,  or  a  redacted  version  of  it, publicly available.
CHAPTER IV

## Article 20
## Governance
- 1. Member States shall ensure that the management bodies of essential and important entities approve the cybersecurity risk-management measures taken by those entities in order to comply with Article 21, oversee its implementation and can be held liable for infringements by the entities of that Article.
The application of this paragraph shall be without prejudice to national law as regards the liability rules applicable to public institutions, as well as the liability of public servants and elected or appointed officials. - 2.
