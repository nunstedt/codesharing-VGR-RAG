In addition, taking into account the implications for the scope of this  Regulation,  the  Commission  should  carry  out  an  assessment  of  the  need  to  amend  the  list  of  high-risk  AI systems and the list of prohibited practices once a year. Moreover, by 2 August 2028 and every four years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate and report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the need to amend the  list  of  high-risk  areas  headings  in  the  annex  to  this  Regulation,  the  AI  systems  within  the  scope  of  the transparency  obligations,  the  effectiveness  of  the  supervision  and  governance  system  and  the  progress  on  the development  of  standardisation  deliverables  on  energy  efficient  development  of  general-purpose  AI  models, including the need for further measures or actions. Finally, by 2 August 2028 and every three years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate the impact and effectiveness of voluntary codes of conduct to foster the application of the  requirements  provided for  high-risk  AI  systems  in  the  case  of  AI  systems  other  than  high-risk  AI  systems  and possibly other  additional  requirements  for  such  AI  systems.
- (175) In  order  to ensure  uniform conditions for  the implementation of  this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council ( 56 ).
- (176) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to improve the functioning of the internal market and to promote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy AI, while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including democracy, the rule of  law and environmental protection against harmful effects of AI systems in the Union and supporting innovation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt
( 54 ) Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of  the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report  breaches  of  Union  law  (OJ  L  305,  ,  p.  17).
( 55 ) OJ L  123,  ,  p.  1.
( 56 ) Regulation  (EU)  No  182/2011  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  16  February  2011  laying  down  the  rules  and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (OJ L  55,  ,  p.  13).
measures  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of  subsidiarity  as  set  out  in  Article  5  TEU.  In  accordance  with  the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to  achieve  that  objective.
- (177) In order to ensure legal certainty, ensure an appropriate adaptation period for operators and avoid disruption to the market, including by ensuring continuity of the use of AI systems, it is appropriate that this Regulation applies to the high-risk AI systems that have been placed on the market or put into service before the general date of application thereof, only if, from that date, those systems are subject to significant changes in their design or intended purpose. It is appropriate to clarify that, in this respect, the concept of significant change should be understood as equivalent in  substance  to  the  notion  of  substantial  modification,  which  is  used  with  regard  only  to  high-risk  AI  systems pursuant to this Regulation.
