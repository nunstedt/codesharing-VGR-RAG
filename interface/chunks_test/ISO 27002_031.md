Software identification (SWID) tags can also help to achieve better information security in the supply chain, by providing information about software provenance. See ISO/IEC 19770-2 for more details.

## Control
The organization should regularly monitor, review, evaluate and manage change in supplier information security practices and service delivery.
## Purpose
To maintain an agreed level of information security and service delivery in line with supplier agreements.
## Guidance
Monitoring,  review  and  change  management  of  supplier  services  should  ensure  the  information security  terms  and  conditions  of  the  agreements  are  complied  with,  information  security  incidents and problems are managed properly and changes in supplier services or business status do not affect service delivery.
This should involve a process to manage the relationship between the organization and the supplier to:
- a) monitor service performance levels to verify compliance with the agreements;
- b) monitor changes made by suppliers including:
- 1) enhancements to the current services offered;
- 2) development of any new applications and systems;
- 3) modifications or updates of the supplier's policies and procedures;
- 4) new  or changed controls to resolve information security incidents and to improve information security;
- c) monitor changes in supplier services including:
- 1) changes and enhancement to networks;
- 2) use of new technologies;
- 3) adoption of new products or newer versions or releases;
- 4) new development tools and environments;
- 5) changes to physical location of service facilities;
- 6) change of sub-suppliers;
- 7) sub-contracting to another supplier;
- d) review service reports produced by the supplier and arrange regular progress meetings as required by the agreements;
- e) conduct audits of suppliers and sub-suppliers, in conjunction with review of independent auditor's reports, if available and follow-up on issues identified;
- f) provide information about information security incidents and review this information as required by the agreements and any supporting guidelines and procedures;
- g) review  supplier  audit  trails  and  records  of  information  security  events,  operational  problems, failures, tracing of faults and disruptions related to the service delivered;
- h) respond to and manage any identified information security events or incidents;
- i) identify information security vulnerabilities and manage them;
- j) review information security aspects of the supplier's relationships with its own suppliers;
- k) ensure  that  the  supplier  maintains  sufficient  service  capability  together  with  workable  plans designed to ensure that agreed service continuity levels are maintained following major service failures or disaster (see , , , ,  );
- l) ensure  that suppliers assign responsibilities for reviewing  compliance  and  enforcing  the requirements of the agreements;
- m)  evaluate regularly that the suppliers maintain adequate information security levels.
The responsibility for managing supplier relationships should be assigned to a designated individual or  team.  Sufficient  technical  skills  and  resources  should  be  made  available  to  monitor  that  the requirements of the agreement, in particular the information security requirements, are being met. Appropriate actions should be taken when deficiencies in the service delivery are observed.

## Control
Processes  for  acquisition,  use,  management  and  exit  from  cloud  services  should  be  established  in accordance with the organization's information security requirements.
## Purpose
To specify and manage information security for the use of cloud services.
