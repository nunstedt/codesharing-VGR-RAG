## Article 27
## Unique Device Identification system
- 1. The  Unique  Device  Identification  system  ('UDI  system')  described  in  Part  C  of  Annex  VI  shall  allow  the  identifiÂ­ cation  and  facilitate  the  traceability  of  devices,  other  than  custom-made  and  investigational  devices,  and  shall  consist  of the following:
- (a)   production of a UDI that comprises the following:
- (i) a  UDI  device  identifier  ('UDI-DI')  specific  to  a  manufacturer  and  a  device,  providing  access  to  the  information laid down in Part B of Annex VI;
- (ii)   a  UDI  production  identifier  ('UDI-PI')  that  identifies  the  unit  of  device  production  and  if  applicable  the  packaged devices, as specified in Part C of Annex VI;
- (b)   placing of  the UDI on the label of  the device or on its packaging;
- (c)   storage  of  the  UDI  by  economic  operators,  health  institutions  and  healthcare  professionals,  in  accordance  with  the conditions laid down in paragraphs 8 and 9 of this Article respectively;
- (d)   establishment of an electronic system for Unique Device Identification ('UDI database') in accordance with Article 28.
- 2. The  Commission  shall,  by  means  of  implementing  acts,  designate  one  or  several  entities  to  operate  a  system  for assignment  of  UDIs  pursuant  to  this  Regulation  ('issuing  entity').  That  entity  or  those  entities  shall  satisfy  all  of  the following criteria:
- (a)   the  entity  is  an  organisation with legal personality;
- (b)   its  system  for  the  assignment  of  UDIs  is  adequate  to  identify  a  device  throughout  its  distribution  and  use  in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation;
- (c)   its  system for  the assignment of UDIs conforms to the relevant international standards;
- (d)   the  entity  gives  access  to  its  system  for  the  assignment  of  UDIs  to  all  interested  users  in  accordance  with  a  set  of predetermined and transparent terms and conditions;
- (e)   the  entity  undertakes to do the following:
- (i) operate its system for  the assignment of UDIs for at least 10 years after its designation;
- (ii)   make available  to  the  Commission  and  to  the  Member  States,  upon  request,  information  concerning  its  system for  the assignment of UDIs;
- (iii)   remain in compliance with the criteria for designation and the terms of designation.
When designating  issuing  entities,  the  Commission  shall  endeavour  to  ensure  that  UDI  carriers,  as  defined  in  Part  C  of Annex  VI,  are  universally  readable  regardless  of  the  system  used  by  the  issuing  entity,  with  a  view  to  minimising financial and administrative burdens for economic operators and health institutions.
- 3. Before  placing  a  device,  other  than  a  custom-made  device,  on  the  market,  the  manufacturer  shall  assign  to  the device  and,  if  applicable,  to  all  higher  levels  of  packaging,  a  UDI  created  in  compliance  with  the  rules  of  the  issuing entity designated by the Commission in accordance with paragraph 2.
Before  a  device,  other  than  a  custom-made  or  investigational  device,  is  placed  on  the  market  the  manufacturer  shall ensure  that  the  information  referred  to  in  Part  B  of  Annex  VI  of  the  device  in  question  are  correctly  submitted  and transferred to the UDI database referred to in Article 28.
