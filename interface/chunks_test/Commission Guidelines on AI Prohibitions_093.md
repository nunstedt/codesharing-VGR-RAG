161 The notion of 'workplace' in Article 5(1)(f) AI Act should also be understood to apply  to  candidates  during  the  selection  and  hiring  process,  consistently  with  other provisions of the AI Act addressing the placing on the market, putting into service or use of AI systems in the area of employment, workers management and access to selfemployment, since there is an imbalance of powers and the intrusive nature of emotion recognition may already apply at the recruitment stage.
## For example:
- -  Using  webcams  and  voice  recognition  systems  by  a  call  centre  to  track  their employee's emotions, such as anger, is prohibited. 162 If  only deployed for personal training purposes, emotion recognition systems are allowed if the results are not shared with HR responsible persons and cannot impact the assessment, promotion etc. of the person trained, provided that the prohibition is not circumvented and the use of the emotion recognition system does not have any impact on the work relationship.
- - Using voice recognition systems by a call centre to track their customers emotions, such as anger or impatience, is not prohibited by Article 5(1)(f) AI Act (for example to help the employees cope with certain angry customers).
- - AI systems monitoring the emotional tone in hybrid work teams by identifying and inferring  emotions  from  voice  and  imagery  of  hybrid  video  calls,  which  would typically  serve  the  purpose  of  fostering  social  awareness,  emotional  dynamics management, and conflict prevention, are prohibited.
