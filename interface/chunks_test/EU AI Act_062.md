High-risk AI systems or general-purpose AI models which are in conformity with the common specifications referred to in paragraph 1, or parts of those specifications, shall be presumed to be in conformity with the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, to comply with the obligations referred to in Sections 2 and 3 of Chapter V, to the  extent  those  common  specifications  cover  those  requirements  or  those  obligations.
- 4. Where  a  harmonised  standard  is  adopted  by  a  European  standardisation  organisation  and  proposed  to  the Commission for the publication of its reference in the Official Journal of the European Union , the Commission shall assess the harmonised  standard  in  accordance  with  Regulation  (EU)  No  1025/2012.  When  reference  to  a  harmonised  standard  is published  in  the Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union ,  the  Commission  shall  repeal  the  implementing  acts  referred  to  in paragraph 1, or parts thereof which cover the same requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, the same obligations  set out  in  Sections  2  and  3  of  Chapter  V.
- 5. Where  providers  of  high-risk  AI  systems  or  general-purpose  AI  models  do  not  comply  with  the  common specifications  referred  to  in  paragraph  1,  they  shall  duly  justify  that  they  have  adopted  technical  solutions  that  meet  the requirements referred to in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, comply with the obligations set out in Sections 2 and 3  of  Chapter  V  to  a  level  at  least  equivalent  thereto.
- 6. Where  a  Member  State  considers  that  a  common  specification  does  not  entirely  meet  the  requirements  set  out  in Section  2  or,  as  applicable,  comply  with  obligations  set  out  in  Sections  2  and  3  of  Chapter  V,  it  shall  inform  the Commission thereof with a detailed explanation. The Commission shall assess that information and, if appropriate, amend the  implementing act establishing  the  common  specification  concerned.
## Article  42
## Presumption of conformity with certain requirements
- 1. High-risk  AI  systems  that  have  been  trained  and  tested  on  data  reflecting  the  specific  geographical,  behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which they are intended to be used shall be presumed to comply with the relevant requirements  laid  down  in  Article  10(4).
- 2. High-risk  AI  systems  that  have  been  certified  or  for  which  a  statement  of  conformity  has  been  issued  under a  cybersecurity  scheme  pursuant  to  Regulation  (EU)  2019/881  and  the  references  of  which  have  been  published  in  the Official Journal of the European Union shall be presumed to comply with the cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 15 of  this  Regulation  in  so  far  as  the  cybersecurity  certificate  or  statement  of  conformity  or  parts  thereof  cover  those requirements.
## Article  43
## Conformity assessment
- 1. For  high-risk  AI  systems  listed  in  point  1  of  Annex  III,  where,  in  demonstrating  the  compliance  of  a  high-risk  AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, the provider has applied harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, or,  where  applicable,  common  specifications  referred  to  in  Article  41,  the  provider  shall  opt  for  one  of  the  following conformity assessment procedures based on:
- (a) the  internal  control  referred  to  in  Annex  VI;  or
- (b) the  assessment  of  the  quality  management  system  and  the  assessment  of  the  technical  documentation,  with  the involvement of a  notified  body,  referred  to  in  Annex  VII.
In  demonstrating  the  compliance  of  a  high-risk  AI  system  with  the  requirements  set  out  in  Section  2,  the  provider  shall follow  the  conformity  assessment  procedure  set  out  in  Annex  VII  where:
- (a) harmonised standards referred to in Article 40 do not exist, and common specifications referred to in Article 41 are not available;
- (b) the  provider  has  not  applied,  or  has  applied  only  part  of,  the  harmonised  standard;
- (c) the  common specifications  referred  to  in point  (a)  exist,  but  the  provider  has  not  applied  them;
- (d) one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been published with a restriction, and only on the part  of  the  standard  that  was  restricted.
For  the  purposes  of  the  conformity  assessment  procedure  referred  to  in  Annex  VII,  the  provider  may  choose  any  of  the notified bodies. However, where the high-risk AI system is intended to be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, the market surveillance authority referred to in Article  74(8)  or  (9),  as  applicable,  shall  act  as  a  notified  body.
- 2. For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III, providers shall follow the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in Annex VI, which does not provide for  the involvement of a notified body.
- 3. For high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I, the provider shall  follow the  relevant conformity assessment procedure as required under  those legal acts. The requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter shall apply to those high-risk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment. Points ., ., . and the  fifth  paragraph  of  point    of  Annex  VII  shall  also  apply.
For  the  purposes  of  that  assessment,  notified  bodies  which  have  been  notified  under  those  legal  acts  shall  be  entitled  to control the conformity of the high-risk AI systems with the requirements set out in Section 2, provided that the compliance of those notified bodies with requirements laid down in Article 31(4), (5), (10) and (11) has been assessed in the context of the  notification  procedure  under  those  legal  acts.
Where a legal act listed in Section A of Annex I enables the product manufacturer to opt out from a third-party conformity assessment, provided that that manufacturer has applied all harmonised standards covering all the relevant requirements, that  manufacturer  may  use  that  option  only  if  it  has  also  applied  harmonised  standards  or,  where  applicable,  common specifications  referred  to  in  Article  41,  covering  all  requirements  set  out  in  Section  2  of  this  Chapter.
- 4. High-risk  AI  systems  that  have  already  been  subject  to  a  conformity  assessment  procedure  shall  undergo  a  new conformity assessment procedure in the event of a substantial modification, regardless of whether  the modified system is intended  to  be  further  distributed  or  continues  to  be  used  by  the  current  deployer.
For high-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into service, changes to the high-risk AI  system  and  its  performance  that  have  been  pre-determined  by  the  provider  at  the  moment  of  the  initial  conformity assessment and are part of the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in point 2(f) of Annex IV, shall  not  constitute  a  substantial  modification.
- 5. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in order to amend Annexes VI and VII  by  updating  them  in  light  of  technical  progress.
- 6. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in order to amend paragraphs 1 and 2 of  this  Article  in  order  to  subject  high-risk  AI  systems  referred  to  in  points  2  to  8  of  Annex  III  to  the  conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII or parts thereof. The Commission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account  the  effectiveness  of  the  conformity  assessment  procedure  based  on  internal  control  referred  to  in  Annex  VI  in preventing or minimising the risks to health and safety and protection of fundamental rights posed by such systems, as well as  the  availability  of  adequate  capacities  and  resources  among  notified  bodies.
## Article  44
## Certificates
- 1. Certificates  issued  by  notified  bodies  in  accordance  with  Annex  VII  shall  be  drawn-up  in  a  language  which  can  be easily  understood by the  relevant  authorities  in  the  Member  State  in  which  the  notified  body  is  established.
- 2. Certificates  shall  be  valid  for  the  period  they  indicate,  which  shall  not  exceed  five  years  for  AI  systems  covered  by Annex I, and four years for AI systems covered by Annex III. At the request of the provider, the validity of a certificate may be  extended  for  further  periods,  each  not  exceeding  five  years  for  AI  systems  covered  by  Annex  I,  and  four  years  for  AI systems  covered  by  Annex  III,  based  on  a  re-assessment  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  conformity  assessment procedures. Any supplement to a certificate shall remain valid, provided that the certificate which it supplements is valid.
- 3. Where a notified body finds that an AI system no longer meets the requirements set out in Section 2, it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend or  withdraw the certificate issued or impose restrictions on it, unless compliance with those requirements is ensured by appropriate corrective action taken by the provider of the system within an  appropriate deadline  set  by  the  notified  body.  The  notified  body  shall  give  reasons  for  its  decision.
An appeal procedure against decisions of the notified bodies, including on conformity certificates issued, shall be available.
## Article  45
## Information obligations of notified bodies
- 1. Notified  bodies  shall  inform  the  notifying  authority of  the  following:
- (a) any  Union  technical  documentation  assessment  certificates,  any  supplements  to  those  certificates,  and  any  quality management system approvals issued in accordance with the requirements of Annex VII;
- (b) any refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a Union technical documentation assessment certificate or a quality management system approval issued in accordance with the requirements of Annex VII;
- (c) any circumstances affecting the scope  of or  conditions  for  notification;
- (d) any  request  for  information  which  they  have  received  from  market  surveillance  authorities  regarding  conformity assessment  activities;
- (e) on  request,  conformity  assessment  activities  performed  within  the  scope  of  their  notification  and  any  other  activity performed, including  cross-border  activities  and  subcontracting.
- 2. Each notified  body  shall  inform  the  other  notified  bodies  of:
- (a) quality  management  system  approvals  which  it  has  refused,  suspended  or  withdrawn,  and,  upon  request,  of  quality system  approvals  which it  has  issued;
- (b) Union  technical  documentation  assessment  certificates  or  any  supplements  thereto  which  it  has  refused,  withdrawn, suspended or otherwise restricted, and, upon request, of the certificates and/or supplements thereto which it has issued.
- 3. Each  notified  body  shall  provide  the  other  notified  bodies  carrying  out  similar  conformity  assessment  activities covering  the  same  types  of  AI  systems  with  relevant  information  on  issues  relating  to  negative  and,  on  request,  positive conformity assessment results.
- 4. Notified bodies shall safeguard the confidentiality of the information that they obtain, in accordance with Article 78.
## Article  46
## Derogation from conformity assessment procedure
- 1. By  way  of  derogation  from  Article  43  and  upon  a  duly  justified  request,  any  market  surveillance  authority  may authorise the placing on the market or the putting into service of specific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member  State  concerned,  for  exceptional  reasons  of  public  security  or  the  protection  of  life  and  health  of  persons, environmental  protection  or  the  protection  of  key  industrial  and  infrastructural  assets.  That  authorisation  shall  be  for a  limited  period  while  the  necessary  conformity  assessment  procedures  are  being  carried  out,  taking  into  account  the exceptional reasons justifying the derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without undue delay.
- 2. In a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in the case of specific, substantial and  imminent  threat  to  the  life  or  physical  safety  of  natural  persons,  law-enforcement  authorities  or  civil  protection authorities  may  put  a  specific  high-risk  AI  system  into  service  without  the  authorisation  referred  to  in  paragraph  1, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use without undue delay. If the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1  is  refused,  the  use  of  the  high-risk  AI  system  shall  be  stopped  with  immediate  effect  and  all  the  results  and outputs  of  such  use  shall  be  immediately  discarded.
- 3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance authority concludes that the  high-risk  AI  system  complies  with  the  requirements  of  Section  2.  The  market  surveillance  authority  shall  inform  the Commission and the other Member States of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2. This obligation shall not  cover  sensitive  operational  data  in  relation  to  the  activities  of  law-enforcement  authorities.
- 4. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 3, no objection has been raised by either  a  Member  State  or  the  Commission  in  respect  of  an  authorisation  issued  by  a  market  surveillance  authority  of a  Member State in  accordance  with  paragraph  1,  that  authorisation  shall  be  deemed  justified.
- 5. Where,  within  15  calendar  days  of  receipt  of  the  notification  referred  to  in  paragraph  3,  objections  are  raised  by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the authorisation to be contrary to Union law, or the conclusion of the Member States regarding the compliance of the system as referred to in paragraph 3 to be unfounded, the Commission shall, without delay, enter  into consultations  with  the  relevant  Member  State.  The  operators  concerned  shall  be  consulted  and  have  the  possibility  to present  their  views.
