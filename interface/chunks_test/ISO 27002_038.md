- d) maintaining appropriate asset registers and identifying all assets with requirements to protect intellectual property rights;

## Other information
Intellectual property rights include software or document copyright, design rights, trademarks, patents and source code licences.
Proprietary software products are usually supplied under a licence agreement that specifies licence terms and conditions, for example, limiting the use of the products to specified machines or limiting copying  to  the  creation  of  backup  copies  only.
