## Other information
Controls to protect information on user endpoint devices depend on whether the user endpoint device is used only inside of the organization's secured premises and network connections, or whether it is exposed to increased physical and network related threats outside of the organization.
The wireless connections for user endpoint devices are similar to other types of network connections but  have  important  differences  that  should  be  considered  when  identifying  controls.  In  particular, back-up  of  information  stored  on  user  endpoint  devices  can  sometimes  fail  because  of  limited network bandwidth or because user endpoint devices are not connected at the times when backups are scheduled.
For some USB ports, such as USB-C, disabling the USB port is not possible because it is used for other purposes (e.g. power delivery and display output).
