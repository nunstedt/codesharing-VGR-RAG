- (107) In  order  to  increase  transparency  on  the  data  that  is  used  in  the  pre-training  and  training  of  general-purpose  AI models, including text and data protected by copyright law, it is adequate that providers of such models draw up and make  publicly  available  a  sufficiently  detailed  summary  of  the  content  used  for  training  the  general-purpose  AI model. While taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential business information, this summary  should  be  generally  comprehensive  in  its  scope  instead  of  technically  detailed  to  facilitate  parties  with legitimate interests, including copyright holders, to exercise and enforce their rights under Union law, for example by listing the main data collections or sets that went into training the model, such as large private or public databases or data archives, and by providing a narrative explanation about other data sources used. It is appropriate for  the AI Office to provide a template for the summary, which should be simple, effective, and allow the provider to provide the  required  summary  in  narrative  form.
- (108) With  regard  to  the  obligations  imposed  on  providers  of  general-purpose  AI  models  to  put  in  place  a  policy  to comply with Union copyright law and make publicly available a summary of the content used for the training, the AI Office  should  monitor  whether  the  provider  has  fulfilled  those  obligations  without  verifying  or  proceeding  to a  work-by-work assessment of  the training data in terms of copyright compliance. This Regulation does not affect the  enforcement of  copyright  rules  as  provided  for  under  Union  law.
