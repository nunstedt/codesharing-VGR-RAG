Critical entity risk assessments shall account for all the relevant natural and man-made risks which could lead to an incident, including those of a cross-sectoral or cross-border nature, accidents, natural disasters, public health emergencies and hybrid threats and other antagonistic threats, including terrorist offences as provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/541. A critical entity risk assessment shall take into account the extent to which other sectors as set out in the Annex depend on the essential service provided by the critical entity and the extent to which that critical entity depends on essential services provided  by  other  entities  in  such  other  sectors,  including,  where  relevant,  in  neighbouring  Member  States  and  third countries.
Where a critical entity has carried out other risk assessments or drawn up documents pursuant to obligations laid down in other legal acts that are relevant for its critical entity risk assessment, it may use those assessments and documents to meet the requirements set out in this Article. When exercising its supervisory functions, the competent authority may declare an existing risk assessment carried out by a critical entity that addresses the risks and extent of dependence referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph as compliant, in whole or in part, with the obligations under this Article.
## Article 13
## Resilience measures of critical entities
- 1. Member  States  shall  ensure  that  critical  entities  take  appropriate  and  proportionate  technical,  security  and organisational  measures  to ensure  their  resilience,  based  on  the  relevant  information provided  by Member  States  on  the Member State risk assessment and on the outcomes of the critical entity risk assessment, including measures necessary to:
- (a) prevent incidents from occurring, duly considering disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measures;
- (b) ensure adequate physical protection of their premises and critical infrastructure, duly considering, for example, fencing, barriers, perimeter monitoring tools and routines, detection equipment and access controls;
- (c) respond to, resist and mitigate the consequences of incidents, duly considering the implementation of risk and crisis management procedures and protocols and alert routines;
- (d) recover  from  incidents,  duly  considering  business  continuity  measures  and  the  identification  of  alternative  supply chains, in order to resume the provision of the essential service;
- (e) ensure adequate employee security management, duly considering measures such as setting out categories of personnel who exercise critical functions, establishing access rights to premises, critical infrastructure and sensitive information, setting up procedures for background checks in accordance with Article 14 and designating the categories of persons who  are  required  to  undergo  such  background  checks,  and  laying  down  appropriate  training  requirements  and qualifications;
- (f) raise awareness about the measures referred to in points (a) to (e) among relevant personnel, duly considering training courses, information materials and exercises.
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, point (e), Member States shall ensure that critical entities take into account the personnel of external service providers when setting out categories of personnel who exercise critical functions.
- 2. Member States shall ensure that critical entities have in place and apply a resilience plan or equivalent document or documents which describe the measures taken pursuant to paragraph 1. Where critical entities have drawn up documents or  taken  measures  pursuant to obligations laid  down in  other  legal  acts  that  are  relevant  for  the  measures  referred  to in paragraph  1,  they  may  use  those  documents  and  measures  to  meet  the  requirements  set  out  in  this  Article.  When exercising its supervisory functions, the competent authority may declare existing resilience-enhancing measures taken by a  critical  entity  that  address,  in  an  appropriate  and  proportionate  manner,  the  technical,  security  and  organisational measures referred to in paragraph 1 as compliant, in whole or in part, with the obligations under this Article. - 3. Member States shall ensure that each critical entity designates a liaison officer or equivalent as the point of contact with the competent authorities.
- 4. At the request of the Member State that has identified the critical entity and with the agreement of the critical entity concerned, the Commission shall organise advisory missions, in accordance with the arrangements set out in Article 18(6), (8)  and  (9),  to  provide  advice  to  the  critical  entity  concerned  in  meeting  its  obligations  under  Chapter  III.  The  advisory mission shall report its findings to the Commission, that Member State and the critical entity concerned.
- 5. The Commission shall, after consulting  the  Critical  Entities  Resilience  Group  referred  to  in  Article  19,  adopt  nonbinding  guidelines  to  further  specify  the  technical,  security  and  organisational  measures  that  may  be  taken  pursuant  to paragraph 1 of this Article.
- 6. The  Commission  shall  adopt  implementing  acts  in  order  to  set  out  the  necessary  technical  and  methodological specifications  relating  to  the  application  of  the  measures  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Article.  Those  implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
## Article 14
## Background checks
- 1. Member  States  shall  specify  the  conditions  under  which  a  critical  entity  is  permitted,  in  duly  reasoned  cases  and taking into account the Member State risk assessment, to submit requests for background checks on persons who:
- (a) hold sensitive  roles  in  or  for  the  benefit  of  the  critical  entity,  in  particular  in  relation  to  the  resilience  of  the  critical entity;
- (b) are authorised to directly or remotely access its premises, information or control systems, including in connection with the security of the critical entity;
- (c) are under consideration for recruitment to positions that fall under the criteria set out in point (a) or (b).
- 2. Requests as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be assessed within a reasonable timeframe and processed in accordance with national law and procedures and relevant and applicable Union law, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive (EU)  2016/680  of  the  European  Parliament and  of the Council ( 37 ). Background  checks  shall be proportionate  and  strictly  limited  to  what  is  necessary.  They  shall  be  carried  out  for  the  sole  purpose  of  evaluating  a potential security risk to the critical entity concerned.
- 3. A background check as referred to in paragraph 1 shall, at least:
- (a) corroborate the identity of the person who is the subject of the background check;
- (b) check the criminal records of that person with regards to offences which would be relevant for a specific position.
When carrying  out  background checks,  Member  States shall  use  the  European  Criminal  Records  Information  System  in accordance  with  the  procedures  set  out  in  Framework  Decision  2009/315/JHA  and,  where  relevant  and  applicable, Regulation (EU) 2019/816 for the purpose of obtaining information from criminal records held by other Member States. The  central  authorities  referred  to  in  Article  3(1)  of  Framework  Decision  2009/315/JHA  and  in  Article  3,  point  (5),  of Regulation (EU) 2019/816 shall provide replies to requests for such information within 10 working days from the date on which the request was received in accordance with Article 8(1) of Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA.

## Incident notification
- 1. Member States shall ensure that critical entities notify the competent authority, without undue delay, of incidents that significantly  disrupt or  have  the  potential  to  significantly  disrupt  the  provision  of essential  services.  Member  States  shall ensure that, unless operationally unable to do so, critical entities submit an initial notification no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of an incident, followed, where relevant, by a detailed report no later than one month thereafter. In order to determine the significance of a disruption, the following parameters shall, in particular, be taken into account:
- (a) the number and proportion of users affected by the disruption;
- (b) the duration of the disruption;
- (c) the geographical area affected by the disruption, taking into account whether the area is geographically isolated.
Where an incident has or might have a significant impact on the continuity of the provision of essential services to or in six or  more  Member  States,  the  competent  authorities  of  the  Member  States  affected  by  the  incident  shall  notify  the Commission of that incident.
- 2. Notifications as referred to in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, shall include any available information necessary to enable the competent authority to understand the nature, cause and possible consequences of the incident, including any available information necessary to determine any cross-border impact of the incident. Such notifications shall not subject critical entities to increased liability.
- 3. On the basis of the information provided by a critical entity in a notification as referred to in paragraph 1, the relevant competent authority, via the single point of contact, shall inform the single point of contact of other affected Member States where the incident has or might have a significant impact on critical entities and the continuity of the provision of essential services to or in one or more other Member States.
Single  points  of  contact  sending  and  receiving  information  pursuant  to  the  first  subparagraph  shall,  in  accordance  with Union  or  national  law,  treat  that  information  in  a  way  that  respects  its  confidentiality  and  protects  the  security  and commercial interest of the critical entity concerned.
- 4. As soon as possible following a notification as referred to in paragraph 1, the competent authority concerned shall provide the critical entity concerned with relevant follow-up information, including information that could support that critical entity's effective response to the incident in question. Member States shall inform the public where they determine that it would be in the public interest to do so.
Article 16
## Standards
In  order  to  promote  the  convergent  implementation  of  this  Directive,  Member  States  shall,  where  useful  and  without imposing  or  discriminating  in  favour  of  the  use  of  a  particular  type  of  technology,  encourage  the  use  of  European  and international  standards  and  technical  specifications  relevant  to  the  security  and  resilience  measures  applicable  to  critical entities. ## CHAPTER IV
## CRITICAL ENTITIES OF PARTICULAR EUROPEAN SIGNIFICANCE
## Article 17
## Identification of critical entities of particular European significance
- 1. An entity shall be considered a critical entity of particular European significance where it:
- (a) has been identified as a critical entity pursuant to Article 6(1);
- (b) provides the same or similar essential services to or in six or more Member States; and
- (c) has been notified pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article.
- 2. Member  States  shall  ensure  that  a  critical  entity,  following  the  notification  referred  to  in  Article  6(3),  informs  its competent authority where it provides essential services to or in six or more Member States. In such a case, Member States shall  ensure  that  the  critical  entity  informs  its  competent  authority  of  the  essential  services  it  provides  to  or  in  those Member States  and  of  the  Member  States  to  which  or  in  which  it  provides  such  essential  services.  Member  States  shall notify the Commission, without undue delay, of the identity of such critical entities and of the information they provide under this paragraph.
The Commission shall consult the competent authority of the Member State which identified a critical entity as referred to in  the  first  subparagraph,  the  competent  authority of other  Member  States  concerned  and  the  critical  entity  in  question. During those consultations, each Member State shall inform the Commission where it deems that the services provided to that Member State by the critical entity are essential services.
- 3. Where the Commission establishes, on the basis of the consultations referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, that the critical  entity concerned provides essential services to or  in six or  more Member States, the Commission shall notify that critical entity, through its competent authority, that it is considered a critical entity of particular European significance and inform that critical entity of its obligations under  this Chapter and the date from which those obligations apply to it. Once the  Commission informs the competent authority of  its  decision  to consider  a  critical  entity  as  a  critical  entity of particular  European  significance,  the  competent  authority  shall  forward  that  notification  to  that  critical  entity  without undue delay.
- 4. This Chapter shall apply to the critical entity of particular European significance concerned from the date of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.
## Article 18

The  Commission  shall,  based  on  the  advice  referred  to  in  the  second  subparagraph  of  this  paragraph,  communicate  its opinion  to  the  Member  State  that  has  identified  a  critical  entity  of  particular  European  significance  as  a  critical  entity pursuant to Article 6(1), to the Member States to or in which the essential service is provided and to that critical entity as to whether  that critical entity complies with its obligations under Chapter III and, where appropriate, as to the measures which could be taken to improve the resilience of that critical entity.
The  Member  State  that  has  identified  a  critical  entity  of  particular  European  significance  as  a  critical  entity  pursuant  to Article  6(1)  shall  ensure  that  its  competent  authority  and  the  critical  entity  concerned  take  into  account  the  opinion referred to in the third subparagraph of this paragraph and provide information to the Commission and the Member States to or in which the essential service is provided on the measures it has taken pursuant to that opinion.
- 5. Each  advisory  mission  shall  consist  of  experts  from  the  Member  State  in  which  the  critical  entity  of  particular European  significance  is  located,  experts  from  the  Member  States  to  or  in  which  the  essential  service  is  provided,  and Commission  representatives.  Those  Member  States  may  propose  candidates  to  be  part  of  an  advisory  mission.  The Commission  shall,  following  a  consultation  with  the  Member  State  that  has  identified  a  critical  entity  of  particular European significance as a critical entity pursuant to Article 6(1), select and appoint the members of each advisory mission in accordance with their professional capacity and ensuring, where possible, a geographically balanced representation from all  those Member States. Whenever necessary, members of the advisory mission shall have valid and appropriate security clearance. The Commission shall bear the costs related to participation in advisory missions.
The Commission shall organise the programme of each advisory mission, in consultation with the members of the advisory mission  in  question  and  in  agreement  with  the  Member  State  that  has  identified  a  critical  entity  of  particular  European significance as a critical entity pursuant to Article 6(1).
- 6. The Commission shall adopt an implementing act laying down rules on the procedural arrangements for requests to organise advisory missions, for handling such requests, for the conduct and reports of advisory missions and for handling the communication of the Commission's opinion referred to in paragraph 4, third subparagraph, of this Article and of the measures taken, duly taking into account the confidentiality and commercial sensitivity of the information concerned. That implementing act shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
- 7. Member States shall ensure that critical entities of particular European significance provide advisory missions with access to information, systems and facilities relating to the provision of their essential services necessary for carrying out the advisory mission concerned.
- 8. Advisory missions shall be carried out in compliance with the applicable national law of the Member State in which they take place, with respect for  that Member State's responsibility for national security and the protection of its security interests. - 9. When organising advisory missions, the Commission shall take into account the reports of any inspections carried out by the Commission under Regulations (EC) No 725/2004 and (EC) No 300/2008 and the reports of any monitoring carried out by the Commission under Directive 2005/65/EC in respect of the critical entity concerned.
- 10. The Commission shall inform the Critical Entities Resilience Group referred to in Article 19 whenever an advisory mission is organised. The Member State in which the advisory mission took place and the Commission shall also inform the Critical Entities Resilience Group of the main findings of the advisory mission and the lessons learned with a view to promoting mutual learning.
