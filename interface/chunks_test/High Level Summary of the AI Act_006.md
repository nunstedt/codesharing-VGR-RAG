## General purpose AI (GPAI) (Chapter V)
GPAI  model means  an  AI  model,  including  when  trained  with  a  large  amount  of  data  using  selfsupervision at scale, that displays significant generality and is capable to competently perform a wide range  of  distinct  tasks  regardless  of  the  way  the  model  is  placed  on  the  market  and  that  can  be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications. This does not cover AI models that are used before release on the market for research, development and prototyping activities.
GPAI  system means  an  AI  system  which  is  based  on  a  general  purpose  AI  model,  that  has  the capability  to  serve  a  variety  of  purposes,  both  for  direct  use  as  well  as  for  integration  in  other  AI systems.
GPAI systems may be used as high risk AI systems or integrated into them. GPAI system providers should cooperate with such high risk AI system providers to enable the latter's compliance.
