These risks can vary considerably between locations and should be taken into account in determining
the  most  appropriate  measures.  The  following  guidelines  should  be  considered  when  siting  this equipment outside of the organization's premises:
- a) physical security monitoring (see  );
- b) protecting against physical and environmental threats (see  );
- c) physical access and tamper proofing controls;
- d) logical access controls.

## Control
Storage  media  should  be  managed  through  their  life  cycle  of  acquisition,  use,  transportation  and disposal in accordance with the organization's classification scheme and handling requirements.
## Purpose
To  ensure  only  authorized  disclosure,  modification,  removal  or  destruction  of  information  on storage media.
## Guidance
## Removable storage media
The following guidelines for the management of removable storage media should be considered:
- a) establishing a topic-specific  policy  on  the  management  of  removable  storage  media  and communicating such topic- specific policy to anyone who uses or handles removable storage media;
- b) where necessary and practical, requiring authorization for storage media to be removed from the organization and keeping a record of such removals in order to maintain an audit trail;
- c) storing all storage media in a safe, secure environment according to their information classification and protecting them against environmental threats (such as heat, moisture, humidity, electronic field or ageing), in accordance with manufacturers' specifications;
- d) if  information  confidentiality  or  integrity  are  important  considerations,  using  cryptographic techniques to protect information on removable storage media;
- e) to mitigate the risk of storage media degrading while stored information is still needed, transferring the information to fresh storage media before becoming unreadable;
- f) storing multiple copies of valuable information on separate storage media to further reduce the risk of coincidental information damage or loss;
- g) considering the registration of removable storage media to limit the chance for information loss;
- h) only enabling removable storage media ports [e.g. secure digital (SD) card slots and universal serial bus (USB) ports] if there is an organizational reason for their use;
- i) where there is a need to use removable storage media, monitoring the transfer of information to such storage media;
- j) information  can  be  vulnerable  to  unauthorized  access,  misuse  or  corruption  during  physical transport, for instance when sending storage media via the postal service or via courier.
In  this  control,  media  includes  paper  documents.  When  transferring  physical  storage  media,  apply security measures in .
## Secure reuse or disposal
Procedures for the secure reuse or disposal of storage media should be established to minimize the risk of confidential information leakage to unauthorized persons. The procedures for secure reuse or disposal of storage media containing confidential information should be proportional to the sensitivity of that information. The following items should be considered:
- a) if  storage media containing confidential information need to be reused within the organization, securely deleting data or formatting the storage media before reuse (see  );
- b) disposing of storage media containing confidential information securely when not needed anymore (e.g. by destroying, shredding or securely deleting the content);
- c) having procedures in place to identify the items that can require secure disposal;
- d) many organizations offer collection and disposal services for storage media. Care should be taken in selecting a suitable external party supplier with adequate controls and experience;
- e) logging the disposal of sensitive items in order to maintain an audit trail;
- f) when  accumulating  storage  media  for  disposal,  giving  consideration  to  the  aggregation  effect, which can cause a large quantity of non-sensitive information to become sensitive.
A risk assessment should be performed on damaged devices containing sensitive data to determine whether the items should be physically destroyed rather than sent for repair or discarded (see ).
