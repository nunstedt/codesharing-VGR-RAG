## Article 64
## Clinical investigations on incapacitated subjects
- 1. In  the  case  of  incapacitated  subjects  who  have  not  given,  or  have  not  refused  to  give,  informed  consent  before  the onset  of  their  incapacity,  a  clinical  investigation  may  be  conducted  only  where,  in  addition  to  the  conditions  set  out  in Article 62(4), all of  the following conditions are met:
- (a)   the  informed consent of  their legally designated representative has been obtained;
- (b)   the  incapacitated subjects have received the information referred to in Article 63(2) in a way that is adequate in view of  their capacity to understand it;
- (c)   the  explicit  wish  of  an  incapacitated  subject  who  is  capable  of  forming  an  opinion  and  assessing  the  information referred  to  in  Article  63(2)  to  refuse  participation  in,  or  to  withdraw  from,  the  clinical  investigation  at  any  time,  is respected by the investigator;
- (d)   no  incentives  or  financial  inducements  are  given  to  subjects  or  their  legally  designated  representatives,  except  for compensation for expenses and loss of earnings directly related to the participation in the clinical investigation;
- (e)   the  clinical  investigation  is  essential  with  respect  to  incapacitated  subjects  and  data  of  comparable  validity cannot  be obtained in clinical investigations on persons able to give informed consent, or by other research methods;
- (f)   the clinical investigation relates directly to a medical condition from which the subject suffers;
- (g)   there  are  scientific  grounds  for  expecting  that  participation  in  the  clinical  investigation  will  produce  a  direct  benefit to the incapacitated subject outweighing the risks and burdens involved.
