Testing vulnerabilities can be interpreted as a potential misuse of the system and can also cause damage to the information system or service, and it can corrupt or obscure digital evidence. Ultimately, this can result in legal liability for the individual performing the testing.

## Control
Security perimeters should be defined and used to protect areas that contain information and other associated assets.
## Purpose
To prevent unauthorized physical access, damage and interference to the organization's information and other associated assets.
## Guidance
The  following  guidelines  should  be  considered  and  implemented  where  appropriate  for  physical security perimeters:
- a) defining security perimeters and the siting and strength of each of the perimeters in accordance with the information security requirements related to the assets within the perimeter;
- b) having  physically  sound  perimeters  for  a  building  or  site  containing  information  processing facilities (i.e. there should be no gaps in the perimeter or areas where a break-in can easily occur).
