## . Detailed  national  law  on  the  supervision  and  the  reporting relating to the authorisation
(418) Article 70 AI Act obliges the Member States to 'establish at least one notifying and one market surveillance authority.' Article 74(8) AI Act provides that 'Member States shall
235 See e.g;, EDPB, Guidelines 05/2022 on the use of facial recognition technology in the area of law enforcement Version , 26 April 2023, p. 24 et seq.
designate as market surveillance authorities for the purposes of this Regulation either the competent data protection supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Directive (EU) 2016/680, or any other authority designated pursuant to the same conditions laid down in Articles 41 to 44 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.'
- (419) This comes on top of the designation of the authorising authority, which the Member State will have to establish before it can authorise the use of real-time RBI systems for any of the objectives listed in Article 5(1)(h)(i) to (iii) AI Act.
## . Annual reports  by  the  national  market  surveillance  authorities  and  the national data protection authorities of Member States
## Article 5(6) AI Act provides
National market surveillance authorities and the national data protection authorities of Member  States  that  have  been  notified  of  the  use  of  'real-time'  remote  biometric identification  systems  in  publicly  accessible  spaces  for  law  enforcement  purposes pursuant to paragraph 4 shall submit to the Commission annual reports on such use. For that  purpose,  the  Commission  shall  provide  Member  States  and  national  market surveillance and data protection authorities with a template, including information on the number of the decisions taken by competent judicial authorities or an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding upon requests for authorisations in accordance with paragraph 3 and their result.
- (420) The national market surveillance authorities and the national data protection authorities of Member States that have been informed by deployers of the use of real-time RBI systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes (see Article 5(4)) must submit annual reports on such use to the Commission. These reports shall be made on  the  basis  of  a  template  provided  by  the  Commission.  This  template  will  be established in due time.
- (421) Where the deployer is an EU Institution, body, or agency, the EDPS is obliged to inform the Commission accordingly on an annual basis of the real-time RBI systems used in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes.
- (422) Only the report of the national data protection authority will cover the period between 2 February 2025 and 2 August 2025, since the AI Act does not require Member States to appoint a national market surveillance authority before the latter date.
- (423) National market surveillance authorities and national data protection authorities are free to decide whether they wish to submit individual reports or a joint report per Member State.
## . Annual reports by the Commission
Article 5(7) AI Act provides
The Commission shall publish annual reports on the use of real-time remote biometric identification  systems  in  publicly  accessible  spaces  for  law  enforcement  purposes, based on aggregated data in Member States on the basis of the annual reports referred to in paragraph 6. Those annual reports shall not include sensitive operational data of the related law enforcement activities.
(424) The AI Act requires the Commission to publish annual reports of the uses of real-time RBI systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes in the Member states and by Union institutions, agencies and bodies, based on aggregated data. These reports will be based on the information notified by the national authorities pursuant to Article 5(6) AI Act.
(425) The Commission's annual report shall not contain sensitive operational data. Sensitive operational data means 'operational data related to activities of prevention, detection, investigation  or  prosecution  of  criminal  offences,  the  disclosure  of  which  could jeopardise  the  integrity  of  criminal  proceedings'. 236 This  could  mean  that  specific details that reveal ongoing or past investigations, such as e.g., locations, camera's used, shall not be published.
## . Out-of-Scope
(426) All other uses of RBI systems that are not covered by the prohibition of Article 5(1)(h) AI Act fall within the category of high-risk AI systems as defined by Article 6 and listed in point 1(a) of Annex III AI Act provided they fall within the scope of the AI Act.
(427) RBI systems that fall outside the scope of the prohibition in Article 5(1)(h) AI Act include biometric verification/authentication systems and the retrospective use of (post) RBI systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes. For instance, police authorities might be authorised by national law to perform retrospective facial recognition to compare images of criminal suspects with recorded facial images in a criminal database. 237 Another use that falls outside the scope of the prohibition is the use of real-time RBI systems for law enforcement purposes in either a private (such as at somebody's place) or an online space (such as the use of a chat room or online game to identify a suspect of disseminating child sexual abuse material). Finally, the use of RBI systems by private actors, both in real-time and retrospective (such as the use of live facial recognition technology by a supermarket to identify known shoplifters, the use of live facial recognition technology by a sports arena to identify individuals banned from entering the arena, or the use of live facial recognition technology in schools for security purposes and school attendance) fall outside the scope of the prohibition.
(428) In addition to the rules that apply to high-risk AI systems generally, the retrospective use of RBI systems for law enforcement purposes is subject to additional conditions
236 Article 3(38) AI Act.
237 For instance, the Traitement des Antécédents Judiciaires database in France, created by Décret no. 2012-652 du 4 mai 2012 relatif au Traitement des Antécédents Judiciaires (Decree 2012-652).
and safeguards  in  accordance  with  Article  26(10)  AI  Act  (in  application  as  from  2 August 2026). 238
(429) Uses for purposes other than for law enforcement must in any event comply with data  protection  rules .  The  cases  below  illustrate  the  interpretation  of  Article  9(2) GDPR in cases of such use and the exceptions to process biometric data.
