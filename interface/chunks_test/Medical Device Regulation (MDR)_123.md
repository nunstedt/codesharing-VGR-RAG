In relation to surveillance audits of manufacturers, the notified body shall have documented procedures to:
- -  conduct  surveillance  audits  of  the  manufacturer  on  at  least  an  annual  basis  which  shall  be  planned  and conducted in line with the relevant requirements in Section ,
- -  ensure  adequate  assessment  of  the  manufacturer's  documentation  on,  and  application  of  the  provisions  on, vigilance, the post-market surveillance, and PMCF,
- -  sample  and  test  devices  and  technical  documentation,  during  audits,  according  to  pre-defined  sampling criteria  and  testing  procedures  to  ensure  that  the  manufacturer  continuously  applies  the  approved  quality management system,
- -  ensure that  the  manufacturer  complies  with  the  documentation  and  information  obligations  laid  down  in  the relevant  Annexes  and  that  its  procedures  take  into  account  best  practices  in  the  implementation  of  quality management systems,
- -  ensure  that  the  manufacturer  does  not  use  quality  management  system  or  device  approvals  in  a  misleading manner,
- -  gather  sufficient  information  to  determine  if  the  quality  management  system  continues  to  comply  with  the requirements of this Regulation,
- -  ask the manufacturer, if non-conformities are detected, for corrections, corrective actions and,  where applicable, preventive actions, and
- -  where necessary, impose specific restrictions on the relevant certificate, or suspend or withdraw it.
The notified body shall, if  listed as part of the conditions for certification:
- -  conduct an in-depth review of  the clinical  evaluation  as  most  recently  updated  by  the  manufacturer  based  on the  manufacturer's  post-market  surveillance,  on  its  PMCF  and  on  clinical  literature  relevant  to  the  condition being treated with the device or on clinical literature relevant to similar devices,
- -  clearly  document  the  outcome  of  the  in-depth  review  and  address  any  specific  concerns  to  the  manufacturer or  impose any specific conditions on it, and
- -  ensure  that  the  clinical  evaluation  as  most  recently  updated,  is  appropriately  reflected  in  the  instructions  for use and, where applicable, the summary of safety and performance.
## .   Re-certification
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  in  place  relating  to  the  re-certification  reviews  and  the renewal  of  certificates.  Re-certification  of  approved  quality  management  systems  or  EU  technical  documentation assessment certificates or EU type-examination certificates shall occur at least every five years.
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  relating  to  renewals  of  EU  technical  documentation assessment  certificates  and  EU  type-examination  certificates  and  those  procedures  shall  require  the  manufacturer in question to submit a summary of changes and scientific findings for  the device, including:
- (a)   all  changes to the originally approved device, including changes not yet notified,
- (b)   experience gained from post-market surveillance,
- (c)   experience from risk management,
- (d)   experience  from  updating  the  proof  of  compliance  with  the  general  safety  and  performance  requirements  set out in Annex I,
- (e)   experience  from  reviews  of  the  clinical  evaluation,  including  the  results  of  any  clinical  investigations  and PMCF,
- (f)   changes to the requirements, to components of the device or to the scientific or regulatory environment,
- (g)   changes to applied or new harmonised standards, CS or equivalent documents, and
- (h)   changes in medical, scientific and technical knowledge, such as:
- -  new treatments,
- -  changes in test methods,
- -  new scientific findings on materials and components, including findings on their biocompatibility,
- -  experience from studies on comparable devices,
- -  data from registers and registries,
- -  experience from clinical investigations with comparable devices.
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  to  assess  the  information  referred  to  in  the  second paragraph  and  shall  pay  particular  attention  to  clinical  data  from  post-market  surveillance  and  PMCF  activities undertaken  since  the  previous  certification  or  re-certification,  including  appropriate  updates  to  manufacturers' clinical evaluation reports.
For  the  decision  on  re-certification,  the  notified  body  in  question  shall  use  the  same  methods  and  principles  as for  the  initial  certification  decision.  If  necessary,  separate forms  shall  be  established  for  re-certification  taking  into account the steps taken for certification such as application and application review.
