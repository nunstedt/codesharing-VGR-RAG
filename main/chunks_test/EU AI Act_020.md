- (53) It  is  also  important  to  clarify  that  there  may  be  specific  cases  in  which  AI  systems  referred  to  in  pre-defined  areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk of harm to the legal interests protected under those areas because they do not materially influence the decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially. For  the purposes of this Regulation, an AI system that does not materially influence the outcome of decision-making should be  understood  to  be  an  AI  system  that  does  not  have  an  impact  on  the  substance,  and  thereby  the  outcome,  of decision-making,  whether  human  or  automated.
