## Chapter 3 Security vetting
## Who is to undergo security vetting
## Section 1
Any person who, by virtue of their employment or in some other way, is to participate in security-sensitive activities must undergo security vetting However, security vetting is not undertaken with regard to:
- 1. assignments as a government minister or as a member of the European Parliament, the Riksdag or a municipal or regional council; or 2. any assignment as a public defence counsel or legal representative before a court other than as a public legal representative under Chapter 27, Section 27 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure or as a privacy protection representative under Section 6 of the Foreign Intelligence Court Act (2009:966). Act 2019:985.
## Aim and substance of security vetting
## Section 2
Security vetting aims to establish whether a person can be assumed to be loyal to the interests protected in this Act and to be otherwise reliable from a security standpoint. During the security vetting, all circumstances that may be assumed to imply security vulnerabilities must be taken into account.
## Section 3
The security vetting is undertaken before participation in the security-sensitive activities commences, and must include a basic investigation and record checks, and a special personal investigation to the extent stated in Sections 13, 14 and 17. If there are special grounds, the security vetting may be less extensive.
Security vetting must be followed up during the period of participation in the securitysensitive activities.
## Responsibility for security vetting
## Section 4
The security vetting process is based on information that has emerged in the basic investigation and any knowledge that otherwise exists about the person being vetted, information disclosed following record checks and the special personal investigation, the nature of the activities that the vetting concerns, and other circumstances.
The assessment is made by the person who decides on the employment or other participation in the security-sensitive activities, unless otherwise stipulated in the third paragraph, Section 4a, Section 4b or Section 4c.
If a public authority has the controlling influence over the vetted person's suitability to participate in the security-sensitive activities of a private operator, it is the authority that makes the final assessment.
If there is reason to do so, a previous assessment of a person's suitability to participate in the security-sensitive activities must be re-examined. Act 2022:443
## Section 4a
The assessment under Section 4 is made by the Judges Proposals Board when it concerns a person who is head of:
- 1. a general court or administrative court;
- 2. the Labour Court; or
- 3. the rent and tenancy tribunal in Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malm√∂.
For other permanent judges at general courts, administrative courts and the Labour Court, and rent tribunal judges in rent and tenancy tribunals, the assessment is made by the relevant court or tribunal. Act 2021:76.
## Section 4b
The final assessment under Section 4 is made by the Swedish Transport Agency when it concerns a person who is to undergo security vetting due to an international protective security commitment in the area of aviation security. Act 2021:952.
## Section 4c
The final assessment under Section 4 is made by the Riksdag Administration when it concerns employees of offices referred to in Chapter 3, Section 6 of the Act concerning Support to Party Groups for the Parliamentary Work of Members of the Riksdag (2016:1109) who have been placed in a security class for participation in activities of the Riksdag or the Riksdag Administration.

- 3. could, as a result of their participation in the activities, cause serious damage to Sweden's security.

- 2. has, to a minor extent, access to information that is classified as secret; or
- 3. could, as a result of their participation in the activities, cause not insignificant harm to Sweden's security.

## Section 10

## Section 11

## Decisions on placement in security classes
## Section 12
The Riksdag and its authorities take decisions on placement in security classes concerning the Riksdag's administrative area.

## Section 15

The Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection decides whether information that has emerged in record checks and a special personal investigation can be disclosed for security vetting.
## Section 20
