## Purpose
To  maintain  the  security  of  information  transferred  within  an  organization  and  with  any  external interested party.
## Guidance
## General
The  organization  should  establish  and  communicate  a  topic-specific  policy  on  information  transfer to all relevant interested parties. Rules, procedures and agreements to protect information in transit
should reflect the classification of the information involved. Where information is transferred between the organization and third parties, transfer agreements (including recipient authentication) should be established and maintained to protect information in all forms in transit (see ).
Information  transfer  can  happen  through  electronic  transfer,  physical  storage  media  transfer  and verbal transfer.
For all types of information transfer, rules, procedures and agreements should include:
- a) controls  designed  to  protect  transferred  information  from  interception,  unauthorized  access, copying,  modification,  misrouting,  destruction  and  denial  of  service,  including  levels  of  access control  commensurate  with  the  classification  of  the  information  involved  and  any  special controls  that  are  required  to  protect  sensitive  information,  such  as  use  of  cryptographic techniques (see  );
- b) controls to ensure traceability and non-repudiation, including maintaining a chain of custody for information while in transit;
- c) identification  of  appropriate  contacts  related  to  the  transfer  including  information  owners,  risk owners, security officers and information custodians, as applicable;
- d) responsibilities and liabilities in the event of information security incidents, such as loss of physical storage media or data;
- e) use of an agreed labelling system for sensitive or critical information, ensuring that the meaning of the labels is immediately understood and that the information is appropriately protected (see  );
- f) reliability and availability of the transfer service;
- g) the topic-specific policy or guidelines on acceptable use of information transfer facilities (see  );
- h) retention and disposal guidelines for all business records, including messages;
NOTE Local legislation and regulations can exist regarding retention and disposal of business records.
- i) the consideration of any other relevant legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements (see  ,  ,  ,  )  related  to  transfer  of  information  (e.g.  requirements  for  electronic signatures).
## Electronic transfer
Rules,  procedures  and  agreements  should  also  consider  the  following  items  when  using  electronic communication facilities for information transfer:
- a) detection of and protection against malware that can be transmitted through the use of electronic communications (see  );
- b) protection of communicated sensitive electronic information that is in the form of an attachment;
- c) prevention against sending documents and messages in communications to the wrong address or number;
- d) obtaining  approval  prior  to  using  external  public  services  such  as  instant  messaging,  social networking, file sharing or cloud storage;
- e) stronger levels of authentication when transferring information via publicly accessible networks;
- f) restrictions associated with electronic communication  facilities (e.g.  preventing  automatic forwarding of electronic mail to external mail addresses);
- g) advising personnel and other interested parties not to send short message service (SMS) or instant messages  with  critical  information  since  these  can  be  read  in  public  places  (and  therefore  by unauthorized persons) or stored in devices not adequately protected;
- h) advising  personnel  and  other  interested  parties  about  the  problems  of  using  fax  machines  or services, namely:
- 1) unauthorized access to built-in message stores to retrieve messages;
- 2) deliberate or accidental programming of machines to send messages to specific numbers.
## Physical storage media transfer
When transferring physical storage media (including paper), rules, procedures and agreements should also include:
- a) responsibilities for controlling and notifying transmission, dispatch and receipt;
- b) ensuring correct addressing and transportation of the message;
- c) packaging  that  protects  the  contents  from  any  physical  damage  likely  to  arise  during  transit and  in  accordance  with  any  manufacturers'  specifications,  for  example  protecting  against  any environmental  factors  that  can  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  restoring  storage  media  such  as exposure  to  heat,  moisture  or  electromagnetic  fields;  using  minimum  technical  standards  for packaging and transmission (e.g.
