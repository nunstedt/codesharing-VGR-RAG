to  enhance  the  resilience  of  critical  entities.  Critical  entities  should  be  in  a  position  to  reinforce  their  ability  to prevent, protect against, respond to, resist, mitigate, absorb, accommodate and recover from incidents that have the potential to disrupt the provision of essential services.

More should also be done to better equip such entities because there is a dynamic threat landscape, which includes evolving hybrid and terrorist threats, and growing interdependencies between infrastructure and sectors. Moreover, there is an increased physical risk due to natural disasters and climate change, which intensifies the frequency and scale of extreme weather events and brings long-term changes in average climate  conditions  that  can  reduce  the  capacity,  efficiency  and  lifespan  of  certain  infrastructure  types  if  climate adaptation measures are not in place.
