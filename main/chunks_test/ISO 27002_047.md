## Control
Physical security for offices, rooms and facilities should be designed and implemented.
## Purpose
To prevent unauthorized physical access, damage and interference to the organization's information and other associated assets in offices, rooms and facilities.
## Guidance
The following guidelines should be considered to secure offices, rooms and facilities:
- a) siting critical facilities to avoid access by the public;
- b) where applicable, ensuring buildings are unobtrusive and give minimum indication of their purpose, with  no  obvious  signs,  outside  or  inside  the  building,  identifying  the  presence  of  information processing activities;
- c) configuring  facilities  to  prevent  confidential  information  or  activities  from  being  visible  and audible from the outside.
