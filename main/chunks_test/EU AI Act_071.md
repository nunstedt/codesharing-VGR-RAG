Microenterprises  within  the  meaning  of  Recommendation  2003/361/EC  may comply  with  certain  elements  of  the quality  management  system  required  by  Article  17  of  this  Regulation  in  a  simplified  manner,  provided  that  they  do  not have  partner  enterprises  or  linked  enterprises  within  the  meaning  of  that  Recommendation.
