It  is  the  DI  assigned  at  the  level  of  the  device  unit of  use.  It  is  the  main  key  for  records  in  the  UDI  database  and  is  referenced  in  relevant  certificates  and  EU declarations of conformity.
## Unit of Use DI
The  Unit  of  Use  DI  serves  to  associate  the  use  of  a  device  with  a  patient  in  instances  in  which  a  UDI  is  not labelled  on  the  individual  device  at  the  level  of  its  unit  of  use,  for  example  in  the  event  of  several  units  of  the same device being packaged together.
## Configurable device
A  configurable device is a device that consists of  several  components  which  can  be  assembled  by  the manufacturer in multiple configurations. Those individual components may be devices in themselves.
Configurable  devices  include  computed  tomography  (CT)  systems,  ultrasound  systems,  anaesthesia  systems, physiological Monitoring systems, radiology information systems (RIS).
## Configuration
Configuration is a combination of items of equipment, as specified by the manufacturer, that operate together as a  device  to  achieve  an  intended  purpose.  The  combination  of  items  may  be  modified,  adjusted  or  customized  to meet specific needs.
## Configurations include inter alia :
- -  gantries,  tubes,  tables,  consoles  and  other  items  of  equipment  that  can  be  configured/combined  to deliver  an intended function in computed tomography.
- -  ventilators, breathing circuits, vaporizers combined to deliver an intended function in anaesthesia.
## UDI-DI
The UDI-DI is a unique numeric or alphanumeric code specific to a model of device and that is also used as the 'access key' to information stored in a UDI database.
Human Readable Interpretation ('HRI')
HRI is a legible interpretation of  the data characters encoded in the UDI carrier.
## Packaging levels
Packaging levels  means  the  various  levels  of  device  packaging  that  contain  a  defined  quantity of  devices,  such  as a carton or case.
## UDI-PI
The UDI-PI is a numeric or alphanumeric code that identifies the unit of device production.
The  different  types  of  UDI-PIs  include  serial  number,  lot  number,  software  identification  and  manufacturing  or expiry date or both types of date.
Radio Frequency Identification RFID
RFID  is  a  technology  that  uses  communication  through  the  use  of  radio  waves  to  exchange  data  between a reader and an electronic tag attached to an object, for  the purpose of identification.
Shipping containers
A shipping container is a container in relation to which traceability is controlled by a process specific to logistics systems.
Unique Device Identifier ('UDI')
The  UDI  is  a  series  of  numeric  or  alphanumeric  characters  that  is  created  through  a  globally  accepted  device identification  and  coding  standard.  It  allows  the  unambiguous  identification  of  a  specific  device  on  the  market. The UDI is comprised of the UDI-DI and the UDI-PI.
The word 'Unique' does not imply serialisation of individual production units.
UDI carrier
The UDI carrier is the means of conveying the UDI by using AIDC and, if applicable, its HRI.
