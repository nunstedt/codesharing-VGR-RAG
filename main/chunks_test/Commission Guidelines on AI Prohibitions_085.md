(see section . out of scope).
- (172) Compliance with the requirements for high-risk AI systems (e.g., in the area of essential public services and benefits, credit-scoring and creditworthiness assessment, migration etc.)  may also help to ensure that AI systems used for evaluation  and classification purposes in those high-risk areas do not constitute unacceptable social scoring practices
that  providers  and  deployers  should  consider  when  implementing  their  respective obligations  (e.g.,  on  risk  management,  transparency,  data  governance,  fundamental rights impact assessment, human oversight, monitoring, etc.).
## . Out of scope
(173) The prohibition in Article 5(1)(c) AI Act only applies to the scoring of natural persons or groups of persons, thus excluding in principle scoring of legal entities  where the evaluation is not based on personal or personality characteristics or social behaviour of individuals, even if in some cases individuals may be indirectly impacted by the score (e.g. all citizens in a municipality in case of allocation of budget). However, if legal entities have been evaluated based on an overall score that aggregates the evaluation or classification of a group of natural persons based on their social behaviour or personal or  personality  characteristics  and  this  score  directly  affects  those  persons  (e.g.,  all employees  in  a  company,  students  in  a  specific  school  whose  behaviour  has  been evaluated), the practice may fall within the scope of Article 5(1)(c) AI Act if all other conditions are fulfilled. This will depend on a case-by-case assessment.
(174) AI-based  social  scoring  as  a  'probabilistic  value'  and  prognosis  should  also  be distinguished from individual ratings by  users which assess the quality of a service (such as a driver in an online car-sharing platform or a host in an online platform for accommodation). Such ratings are the mere aggregation of individual human scores that do not necessarily involve AI, unless the data are combined with other information and analysed  by  the  AI  system  for  evaluating  or  classifying  individuals  fulfilling  all conditions in Article 5(1)(c) AI Act.
- (175) Furthermore, the scoring of natural persons is not at all times prohibited, but only in the limited cases where all of the conditions of Article 5(1)(c) AI Act are cumulatively fulfilled,  as  analysed  above.  Recital  31  AI  Act,  in  particular  mentions  that  the prohibition 'should not affect lawful evaluation practices of natural persons that are carried  out  for  a  specific  purpose  in  accordance  with  Union  and  national  law'.  For example, credit scoring and risk scoring and underwriting are essential aspects of the services  of  financial  and  insurance  businesses.  Such  practices,  as  well  as  other legitimate practices (i.e. to improve the quality and efficiency of services, to ensure more  efficient  claims  handling,  to  perform  specific  employee  evaluations,  fraud prevention and detection, law enforcement or scoring of users' behaviour on online platforms), are not per se prohibited, if lawful and undertaken in line with the AI Act and other applicable Union law and national law, which must comply with Union law.
(176) In other words, AI systems which evaluate or classify individuals for the purposes of generating a social score in a lawful manner and for a specific purpose in the related context as that in which the personal data used for the score were collected are not
prohibited,  provided  that  any  detrimental  or  unfavourable  treatment  from  using  the score is justified and proportionate to the gravity of the social behaviour. 125
(177) Compliance with sectoral Union legislation, such as in the field of credit-scoring, antimoney laundering, etc., that specifies the type of data that can be used as relevant and necessary  for  the  specific  legitimate  purpose  of  evaluation  and  ensures  that  the treatment is justified and proportionate to the social behaviour may thus ensure that the AI practice falls outside the scope of the prohibition in Article 5(1)(c) AI Act.
Examples of legitimate scoring practices in line with Union and national law that are outside the scope of Article 5(1)(c) AI Act:
- - Financial credit scoring systems used by creditors or credit information agencies to assess a customer's financial creditworthiness or outstanding debts, providing a credit score  or  determining  their  creditworthiness  assessment,  which  are  based  on  the customer's income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances, are out of scope of Article 5(1)(c) AI Act if they are relevant for the legitimate purpose of the credit scoring and if they comply with consumer protection laws 126 specifying the type of data and the necessary safeguards to ensure the fair treatment of consumers in creditworthiness assessments.
