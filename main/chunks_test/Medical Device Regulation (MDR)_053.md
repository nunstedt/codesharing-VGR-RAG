## Article 65
## Clinical investigations on minors
A clinical  investigation  on  minors  may  be  conducted  only  where,  in  addition  to  the  conditions  set  out  in  Article  62(4), all  of  the  following conditions are met:
- (a)   the  informed consent of  their legally designated representative has been obtained; - (b)   the  minors  have  received  the  information  referred  to  in  Article  63(2)  in  a  way  adapted  to  their  age  and  mental maturity  and  from  investigators  or  members  of  the  investigating  team  who  are  trained  or  experienced  in  working with children;
- (c)   the  explicit  wish  of  a  minor  who  is  capable  of  forming  an  opinion  and  assessing  the  information  referred  to  in Article  63(2)  to  refuse  participation  in,  or  to  withdraw  from,  the  clinical  investigation  at  any  time,  is  respected  by the investigator;
- (d)   no  incentives  or  financial  inducements  are  given  to  the  subject  or  his  or  her  legally  designated  representative  except for compensation for expenses and loss of earnings directly related to the participation in the clinical investigation;
- (e)   the  clinical  investigation  is  intended  to  investigate  treatments  for  a  medical  condition  that  only  occurs  in  minors  or the  clinical  investigation  is  essential  with  respect  to  minors  to  validate  data  obtained  in  clinical  investigations  on persons able to give informed consent or by other research methods;
- (f) the  clinical  investigation  either  relates  directly  to  a  medical  condition  from  which  the  minor  concerned  suffers  or  is of such a nature that it can only be carried out on minors;
- (g)   there  are  scientific  grounds  for  expecting  that  participation  in  the  clinical  investigation  will  produce  a  direct  benefit to the minor subject outweighing the risks and burdens involved;
- (h)   the  minor shall take part in the informed consent procedure in a way adapted to his or her age and mental maturity;
- (i) if  during  a  clinical  investigation  the  minor  reaches  the  age  of  legal  competence  to  give  informed  consent  as  defined in  national law, his or her express informed consent shall be obtained before that subject can continue to participate in the clinical investigation.
