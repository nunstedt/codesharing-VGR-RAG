- (d)   have  documented  procedures  requiring  the  review  of  pre-application  information,  including  the  preliminary verification  that the product is covered by this Regulation and its classification, prior  to issuing any quotation to the manufacturer relating to a specific conformity assessment; and

The  contract  between  a  notified  body  and  a  manufacturer  shall  take  the  form  of  a  written  agreement  signed  by both parties. It shall be kept by the notified body. This contract shall have clear  terms and conditions and contain obligations  that  enable  the  notified  body  to  act  as  required  under  this  Regulation,  including  an  obligation  on  the manufacturer  to  inform  the  notified  body  of  vigilance  reports,  the  right  of  the  notified  body  to  suspend,  restrict or  withdraw certificates issued and the duty of the notified body to fulfil its information obligations.
The notified body shall have documented procedures to review applications, addressing:
- (a)   the completeness of those applications with respect to the requirements of the relevant conformity assessment procedure, as referred to in the corresponding Annex, under  which approval has been sought,
- (b)   the  verification  of  the  qualification  of  products  covered  by  those  applications  as  devices  and  their  respective classifications,
- (c)   whether  the  conformity  assessment  procedures  chosen  by  the  applicant  are  applicable  to  the  device  in question under  this Regulation,
- (d)   the  ability of  the notified  body to assess the application based on its designation, and
- (e)   the  availability of sufficient and appropriate resources.
The outcome of each review of an application shall be documented. Refusals or  withdrawals of applications shall be notified to the electronic system referred to in Article 57 and shall be accessible to other notified bodies.
## . Allocation of resources
The  notified  body  shall  have  documented  procedures  to  ensure  that  all  conformity  assessment  activities  are conducted by appropriately authorised and qualified personnel who are sufficiently experienced in the evaluation of  the devices, systems and processes and related documentation that are subject to conformity assessment.
