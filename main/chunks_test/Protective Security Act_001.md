## Protective Security Act (2018:585)
## Chapter 1 Scope of the Act
## This Act applies to operators of security-sensitive activities
## Section 1
This Act applies to anyone who to any extent conducts activities that are of significance to Sweden's security or are covered by an international protective security commitment that is binding on Sweden ('security-sensitive activities').
The Act also contains provisions concerning anyone who intends to transfer shares in a legal person that operates security-sensitive activities and concerning international cooperation in the area of protective security. Act 2020:1007.
## The meaning of 'protective security'
## Section 2
'Protective security' means protection of security-sensitive activities against espionage, sabotage, terrorist offences and other offences that may threaten those activities, and protection in other cases of classified information.
'Classified information' means information that concerns security-sensitive activities and is thus covered by secrecy under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400), or that would have been subject to secrecy under that Act if it had been applicable.
## Exemptions from the protective security provisions
## Section 3
The only provisions of this Act that apply to the Riksdag and its authorities are those on security classification in Chapter 2, Section 5, on security vetting in Chapter 3 and on security certificates in Chapter 5. Otherwise, the Act on Protective Security in the Riksdag and its Authorities (2019:109) applies.
As regards the Government Offices, Sweden's diplomatic missions abroad and government commissions, committees and inquiries, the Government may issue regulations on exemptions to provisions in this Act other than those referred to in the first paragraph. Act 2021:952.
Special provisions on the Prime Minister's official residences and facilities with protected status

The Act on Responsibility for Certain Security Matters in the Prime Minister's Official Residences (2014:514) contains provisions on responsibility for physical security and on the obligation to consult before protective security agreements are concluded and ahead of decisions on placement in security classes.
## Section 5
The Installations Protection Act (2010:305) contains provisions on prohibitions on access to certain buildings, other facilities, areas and other objects.
## Chapter 2 Fundamental provisions on protective security
## Obligations for operators of security-sensitive activities
## Section 1
A person who conducts security-sensitive activities (operator) must investigate the need for protective security (protective security analysis). The protective security analysis must be documented.
Based on this analysis, the operator must plan and take any protective security measures required considering the nature and scope of the activities, the presence of classified information and other circumstances.
The operator must also undertake controls of protective security in its own activities, notify and report anything that is of significance to protective security and otherwise take any measures required under this Act.
