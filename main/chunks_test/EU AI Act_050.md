Those characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of individual data sets or at the level of a combination thereof.
- 4. Data sets shall take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the characteristics or elements that are  particular  to  the  specific  geographical,  contextual,  behavioural  or  functional  setting  within  which  the  high-risk  AI system  is  intended  to  be  used.
- 5. To the extent that it is strictly necessary for  the purpose of ensuring bias detection and correction in relation to the high-risk AI systems in accordance with paragraph (2), points (f) and (g) of this Article, the providers of such systems may exceptionally process special categories of personal data, subject to appropriate safeguards for  the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. In addition to the provisions set out in Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive  (EU)  2016/680,  all  the  following  conditions  must  be  met  in  order  for  such  processing  to  occur:
- (a) the  bias  detection  and  correction  cannot  be  effectively  fulfilled  by  processing  other  data,  including  synthetic  or anonymised data;
- (b) the  special  categories  of  personal  data  are  subject  to  technical  limitations  on  the  re-use  of  the  personal  data,  and state-of-the-art  security  and  privacy-preserving  measures,  including  pseudonymisation;
- (c) the special categories of personal data are subject to measures to ensure that the personal data processed are secured, protected, subject to suitable safeguards, including strict controls and documentation of the access, to avoid misuse and ensure  that  only  authorised  persons  have  access  to  those  personal  data  with  appropriate  confidentiality obligations;
- (d) the  special  categories  of  personal  data  are  not  to  be  transmitted,  transferred  or  otherwise  accessed  by other  parties;
- (e) the special categories of personal data are deleted once the bias has been corrected or the personal data has reached the end  of  its  retention  period,  whichever  comes  first;
- (f) the  records  of  processing  activities  pursuant  to  Regulations  (EU)  2016/679  and  (EU)  2018/1725  and  Directive  (EU) 2016/680 include the reasons why the processing of special categories of personal data was strictly necessary to detect and correct  biases,  and  why that  objective  could  not  be  achieved  by  processing  other  data.
- 6. For the development of high-risk AI systems not using techniques involving the training of AI models, paragraphs 2 to  5  apply only  to  the  testing  data  sets.
## Article  11
## Technical documentation
- 1. The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system is placed on the market or put  into  service  and  shall  be  kept  up-to  date.
The technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way as to demonstrate that the high-risk AI system complies with the  requirements  set  out  in  this  Section  and  to  provide  national  competent  authorities  and  notified  bodies  with  the necessary  information  in  a  clear  and  comprehensive  form  to  assess  the  compliance  of  the  AI  system  with  those requirements.
