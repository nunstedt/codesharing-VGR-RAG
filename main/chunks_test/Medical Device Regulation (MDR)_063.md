Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 114(3).
## Article 98
## Preventive health protection measures
- 1. Where a Member State, after having performed an evaluation which indicates a potential risk related to a device or a  specific  category  or  group  of  devices,  considers  that,  in  order  to  protect  the  health  and  safety  of  patients,  users  or other persons or other aspects of public health, the making available on the market or putting into service of a device or a  specific  category  or  group  of  devices  should  be  prohibited,  restricted  or  made  subject  to  particular  requirements  or that  such  device  or  category  or  group  of  devices  should  be  withdrawn  from  the  market  or  recalled,  it  may  take  any necessary and justified measures. - 2.

Where  such  a  measure  is  addressed  to  a  specific  economic  operator,  the competent authority shall notify without delay the economic operator concerned of  that measure, and shall at the same time  inform  that  economic  operator  of  the  remedies  available  under  the  law  or  the  administrative  practice  of  the Member State concerned and of the time limits to which such remedies are subject. Where the measure is of general apÂ­ plicability, it shall be appropriately published.
