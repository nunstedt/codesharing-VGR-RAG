Where a software package needs to be modified the following points should be considered:
- a) the risk of built-in controls and integrity processes being compromised;
- b) whether to obtain the consent of the vendor;
- c) the possibility of obtaining the required changes from the vendor as standard program updates;
- d) the impact if the organization becomes responsible for the future maintenance of the software as a result of changes;
- e) compatibility with other software in use.
## Other information
A  guiding  principle  is  to  ensure  security-relevant  code  is  invoked  when  necessary  and  is  tamperresistant.  Programs  installed  from  compiled  binary  code  also  have  these  properties  but  only  for data held within the application. For interpreted languages, the concept only works when the code is executed on a server that is otherwise inaccessible by the users and processes that use it, and that its data is held in a similarly protected database. For example, the interpreted code can be run on a cloud service where access to the code itself requires administrator privileges. Such administrator access should be protected by security mechanisms such as just-in-time administration principles and strong
authentication.
