## DIRECTIVE (EU) 2022/2555 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 14 December 2022
on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union, amending Regulation (EU) No  910/2014  and  Directive  (EU)  2018/1972,  and  repealing  Directive  (EU)  2016/1148  (NIS  2 Directive)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank ( 1 ),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 2 ),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 3 ),
Whereas:
- (1) Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and the Council ( 4 ) aimed to build cybersecurity capabilities across  the  Union,  mitigate  threats  to  network  and  information  systems  used  to  provide  essential  services  in  key sectors and ensure the continuity of such services when facing incidents, thus contributing to the Union's security and to the effective functioning of its economy and society.
- (2) Since the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2016/1148, significant progress has been made in increasing the Union's level of cyber resilience. The review of that Directive has shown that it has served as a catalyst for the institutional and regulatory  approach to cybersecurity in the Union, paving the way for a significant change in mind-set. That Directive has ensured the completion of national frameworks on the security of network and information systems by  establishing  national  strategies  on  security  of  network  and  information  systems  and  establishing  national capabilities  and  by  implementing  regulatory  measures  covering  essential  infrastructures  and  entities  identified  by each  Member  State.  Directive  (EU)  2016/1148  has  also  contributed  to  cooperation  at  Union  level  through  the establishment of  the Cooperation Group and the network of national computer security incident response teams. Notwithstanding those achievements, the review of Directive (EU) 2016/1148 has revealed inherent shortcomings that prevent it from addressing effectively current and emerging cybersecurity challenges.
- (3) Network  and  information  systems  have  developed  into  a  central  feature  of  everyday  life  with  the  speedy  digital transformation and interconnectedness of society, including in cross-border exchanges. That development has led to an expansion of the cyber threat landscape, bringing about new challenges, which require adapted, coordinated and innovative  responses  in  all  Member  States.  The  number,  magnitude,  sophistication,  frequency  and  impact  of incidents  are  increasing,  and  present  a  major  threat  to  the  functioning  of  network  and  information  systems. As  a result,  incidents  can  impede  the  pursuit  of  economic  activities  in  the  internal  market,  generate  financial  loss,
