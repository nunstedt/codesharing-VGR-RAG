The first  subparagraph shall not apply to any person who, while not considered a manufacturer as defined in point (30) of  Article  2,  assembles  or  adapts  for  an  individual  patient  a  device  already  on  the  market  without  changing  its  intended purpose.
- 2. For  the purposes of point (c) of paragraph 1, the following shall not be considered to be a modification of a device that could affect its compliance with the applicable requirements:
- (a)   provision,  including  translation,  of  the  information  supplied  by  the  manufacturer,  in  accordance  with  Section  23  of Annex I, relating to a device already placed on the market and of further  information which is necessary in order  to market the device in the relevant Member State;
- (b)   changes  to  the  outer  packaging  of  a  device  already  placed  on  the  market,  including  a  change  of  pack  size,  if  the repackaging  is  necessary  in  order  to  market  the  device  in  the  relevant  Member  State  and  if  it  is  carried  out  in  such conditions  that  the  original  condition  of  the  device  cannot  be  affected  by  it.  In  the  case  of  devices  placed  on  the market  in  sterile  condition,  it  shall  be  presumed  that  the  original  condition  of  the  device  is  adversely  affected  if  the packaging that is necessary for  maintaining the sterile condition is opened, damaged or otherwise negatively affected by the repackaging.
