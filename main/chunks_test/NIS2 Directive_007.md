Those  arrangements  should  be  established  in  accordance  with  the  Union competition rules and Union data protection law. - (121) The processing of personal data, to the extent necessary and proportionate for the purpose of ensuring security of network and information systems by essential and important entities, could be considered to be lawful on the basis that  such  processing  complies  with  a  legal  obligation  to  which  the  controller  is  subject,  in  accordance  with  the requirements of Article 6(1), point (c), and Article 6(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Processing of personal data could also be necessary for legitimate interests pursued by essential and important entities, as well as providers of security technologies and services acting on behalf of those entities, pursuant to Article 6(1), point (f), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, including where such processing is necessary for cybersecurity information-sharing arrangements or the  voluntary  notification  of  relevant  information  in  accordance  with  this  Directive.  Measures  related  to  the prevention, detection, identification, containment, analysis and response to incidents, measures to raise awareness in  relation  to  specific  cyber  threats,  exchange  of  information  in  the  context  of  vulnerability  remediation  and coordinated  vulnerability  disclosure,  the  voluntary  exchange  of  information  about  those  incidents,  and  cyber threats  and  vulnerabilities,  indicators  of  compromise,  tactics,  techniques  and  procedures,  cybersecurity  alerts  and configuration tools could require the processing of certain categories of personal data, such as IP addresses, uniform resources  locators  (URLs),  domain  names,  email  addresses  and,  where  they  reveal  personal  data,  time  stamps. Processing  of  personal  data  by  the  competent  authorities,  the  single  points  of  contact  and  the  CSIRTs,  could constitute a legal obligation or be considered to be necessary for carrying out a task in the public interest or in the exercise  of  official  authority  vested  in  the  controller  pursuant  to  Article  6(1),  point  (c)  or  (e),  and  Article  6(3)  of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or for pursuing a legitimate interest of the essential and important entities, as referred to in Article 6(1), point (f), of that Regulation. Furthermore, national law could lay down rules allowing the competent authorities,  the  single  points  of  contact  and  the  CSIRTs,  to  the  extent  that  is  necessary  and  proportionate  for  the purpose of ensuring the security of network and information systems of essential and important entities, to process special  categories  of  personal  data  in  accordance  with  Article  9  of  Regulation  (EU)  2016/679,  in  particular  by providing  for  suitable  and  specific  measures  to  safeguard  the  fundamental  rights  and  interests  of  natural  persons, including  technical  limitations  on  the  re-use  of  such  data  and  the  use  of  state-of-the-art  security  and  privacypreserving  measures,  such  as  pseudonymisation,  or  encryption  where  anonymisation  may  significantly  affect  the purpose pursued.
- (122) In  order  to  strengthen  the  supervisory  powers  and  measures  that  help  ensure  effective  compliance,  this  Directive should  provide  for  a  minimum  list of  supervisory  measures  and  means  through  which the  competent  authorities can  supervise  essential  and  important  entities.  In  addition,  this  Directive  should  establish  a  differentiation  of supervisory regime between essential and important entities with a view to ensuring a fair balance of obligations on those entities and on the competent authorities. Therefore, essential entities should be subject to a comprehensive ex ante and ex  post supervisory regime, while important entities should be subject to a light, ex  post only, supervisory regime. Important  entities should therefore not be required to systematically  document  compliance  with cybersecurity  risk-management  measures,  while  the  competent  authorities  should  implement  a  reactive ex  post approach  to  supervision  and,  hence,  not  have  a  general  obligation  to  supervise  those  entities.  The ex  post supervision of important entities may be triggered by evidence, indication or information brought to the attention of  the  competent  authorities  considered  by  those  authorities  to  suggest  potential  infringements  of  this  Directive. For example, such evidence, indication or information could be of the type provided to the competent authorities by other  authorities,  entities,  citizens,  media  or  other  sources  or  publicly  available  information,  or  could  emerge from other activities conducted by the competent authorities in the fulfilment of their tasks.
- (123) The  execution  of  supervisory  tasks  by  the  competent  authorities  should  not  unnecessarily  hamper  the  business activities  of  the  entity  concerned.  Where  the  competent  authorities  execute  their  supervisory  tasks  in  relation  to essential  entities,  including  the  conduct  of  on-site  inspections  and  off-site  supervision,  the  investigation  of infringements  of  this  Directive  and  the  conduct  of  security  audits  or  security  scans,  they  should  minimise  the impact on the business activities of the entity concerned.
- (124) In the exercise of ex ante supervision, the competent authorities should be able to decide on the prioritisation of the use of supervisory measures and means at their disposal in a proportionate manner. This entails that the competent authorities can decide on such prioritisation based on supervisory methodologies which should follow a risk-based approach.  More  specifically,  such  methodologies  could  include  criteria  or  benchmarks  for  the  classification  of essential  entities  into  risk  categories  and  corresponding  supervisory  measures  and  means  recommended  per  risk category,  such  as  the  use,  frequency  or  types  of  on-site  inspections,  targeted  security  audits  or  security  scans,  the type  of  information  to  be  requested  and  the  level  of  detail  of  that  information.  Such  supervisory  methodologies could  also  be  accompanied  by  work  programmes  and  be  assessed  and  reviewed  on  a  regular  basis,  including  on aspects such as resource allocation and needs. In relation to public administration entities, the supervisory powers should be exercised in line with the national legislative and institutional frameworks.
- (125) The competent authorities should ensure that their supervisory tasks in relation to essential and important entities are carried out by trained professionals, who should have the necessary skills to carry out those tasks, in particular with regard to conducting on-site inspections and off-site supervision, including the identification of weaknesses in databases,  hardware,  firewalls,  encryption  and  networks.  Those  inspections  and  that  supervision  should  be conducted in an objective manner.
- (126) In  duly  substantiated  cases  where  it  is  aware  of  a  significant  cyber  threat  or  an  imminent  risk,  the  competent authority should be able to take immediate enforcement decisions with the aim of preventing or responding to an incident.
- (127) In order to make enforcement effective, a minimum list of enforcement powers that can be exercised for breach of the cybersecurity risk-management measures and reporting obligations provided for in this Directive should be laid down, setting up a clear and consistent framework for such enforcement across the Union. Due regard should be given to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement of this Directive, the material or non-material damage caused, whether the infringement was intentional or negligent, actions taken to prevent or mitigate the material or non-material damage, the degree of responsibility or any relevant previous infringements, the degree of cooperation with the competent authority and any other aggravating or mitigating factor. The enforcement measures, including administrative  fines,  should  be  proportionate  and  their  imposition  should  be  subject  to  appropriate  procedural safeguards  in  accordance  with  the  general  principles  of  Union  law  and  the  Charter  of  Fundamental  Rights  of  the European  Union  (the  'Charter'),  including  the  right  to  an  effective  remedy  and  to  a  fair  trial,  the  presumption  of innocence and the rights of the defence.
- (128) This Directive does not require Member States to provide for criminal or civil liability with regard to natural persons with responsibility for ensuring that an entity complies with this Directive for damage suffered by third parties as a result of an infringement of this Directive.
- (129) In  order  to  ensure  effective  enforcement  of  the  obligations  laid  down  in  this  Directive,  each  competent  authority should have the power to impose or request the imposition of administrative fines.
- (130) Where an administrative fine is imposed on an essential or important entity that is an undertaking, an undertaking should  be  understood  to  be  an  undertaking  in  accordance  with  Articles  101  and  102  TFEU  for  those  purposes. Where an administrative fine is imposed on a person that is not an undertaking, the competent authority should take  account  of  the  general  level  of  income  in  the  Member  State  as  well  as  the  economic  situation  of  the  person when considering the appropriate amount of the fine. It should be for the Member States to determine whether and to what extent public authorities should be subject to administrative fines. Imposing an administrative fine does not affect the application of other powers of the competent authorities or of other penalties laid down in the national rules transposing this Directive.
- (131) Member States should be able to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for  infringements of  the national rules transposing  this  Directive.  However,  the  imposition  of  criminal  penalties  for  infringements  of  such  national  rules and of related administrative penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis in idem , as interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
- (132) Where this Directive does not harmonise administrative penalties or where necessary in other cases, for example in the event of a serious infringement of this Directive, Member States should implement a system which provides for effective,  proportionate  and  dissuasive  penalties.  The  nature  of  such  penalties  and  whether  they  are  criminal  or administrative should be determined by national law. - (133) In  order  to  further  strengthen  the  effectiveness  and  dissuasiveness  of  the  enforcement  measures  applicable  to infringements  of  this  Directive,  the  competent  authorities  should  be  empowered  to  suspend  temporarily  or  to request the temporary suspension of a certification or authorisation concerning part or all of the relevant services provided or activities carried out by an essential entity and request the imposition of a temporary prohibition of the exercise  of  managerial  functions  by  any  natural  person  discharging  managerial  responsibilities  at  chief  executive officer or legal representative level. Given their severity and impact on the entities' activities and ultimately on users, such  temporary  suspensions  or  prohibitions  should  only  be  applied  proportionally  to  the  severity  of the infringement and taking account of the circumstances of each individual case, including whether the infringement was  intentional  or  negligent,  and  any  actions  taken  to  prevent  or  mitigate  the  material  or  non-material  damage. Such temporary  suspensions  or  prohibitions  should  only  be  applied  as  a  last  resort,  namely  only  after  the  other relevant enforcement measures laid down in this Directive have been exhausted, and only until the entity concerned takes the necessary action to remedy the deficiencies or comply with the requirements of the competent authority for which such temporary suspensions or prohibitions were applied. The imposition of such temporary suspensions or prohibitions should be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the general principles of Union  law  and  the  Charter,  including  the  right  to  an  effective  remedy  and  to  a  fair  trial,  the  presumption  of innocence and the rights of the defence.
- (134) For  the purpose of ensuring entities' compliance with their obligations laid down in this Directive, Member States should  cooperate  with  and  assist  each  other  with  regard  to  supervisory  and  enforcement  measures,  in  particular where an entity provides services in more than one Member State or where its network and information systems are located  in  a  Member  State  other  than  that  where  it  provides  services.  When  providing  assistance,  the  requested competent authority should take supervisory or enforcement measures in accordance with national law. In order to ensure the smooth functioning of mutual assistance under this Directive, the competent authorities should use the Cooperation Group as a forum to discuss cases and particular requests for assistance.
- (135) In order to ensure effective supervision and enforcement, in particular in a situation with a cross-border dimension, a  Member  State  that  has  received  a  request  for  mutual  assistance  should,  within  the  limits  of  that  request,  take appropriate supervisory and enforcement measures in relation to the entity that is the subject of that request, and that provides services or has a network and information system on the territory of that Member State.
- (136) This Directive should establish cooperation rules between the competent authorities and the supervisory authorities under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to deal with infringements of this Directive related to personal data.
- (137) This Directive should aim to ensure a high level of responsibility for  the cybersecurity risk-management measures and reporting obligations at the level of the essential and important entities. Therefore, the management bodies of the essential and important entities should approve the cybersecurity risk-management measures and oversee their implementation.
- (138) In order to ensure a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union on the basis of this Directive, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of supplementing this  Directive  by  specifying  which  categories  of  essential  and  important  entities  are  to  be  required  to  use  certain certified  ICT  products,  ICT  services  and  ICT  processes  or  obtain  a  certificate  under  a  European  cybersecurity certification scheme. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its  preparatory  work,  including  at expert  level,  and  that  those  consultations  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making ( 22 ).  In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same time as Member States' experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts. - (139) In  order  to  ensure  uniform  conditions  for  the  implementation  of  this  Directive,  implementing  powers  should  be conferred  on  the  Commission  to  lay  down  the  procedural  arrangements  necessary  for  the  functioning  of  the Cooperation  Group  and  the  technical  and  methodological  as  well  as  sectoral  requirements  concerning  the cybersecurity  risk-management  measures,  and  to  further  specify  the  type  of  information,  the  format  and  the procedure of incident, cyber threat and near miss notifications and of significant cyber  threat communications, as well  as  cases  in  which  an  incident  is  to  be  considered  to  be  significant.  Those  powers  should  be  exercised  in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 23 ).
- (140) The Commission should periodically review this Directive, after consulting stakeholders, in particular with a view to determining whether it is appropriate to propose amendments in light of changes to societal, political, technological or market conditions. As part of those reviews, the Commission should assess the relevance of the size of the entities concerned,  and  the  sectors,  subsectors  and  types  of  entity  referred  to  in  the  annexes  to  this  Directive  for  the functioning  of  the  economy  and  society  in  relation  to  cybersecurity.  The  Commission  should  assess,  inter  alia, whether  providers,  falling  within  the  scope  of  this  Directive,  that  are  designated  as  very  large  online  platforms within the meaning of Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 24 ) could be identified as essential entities under this Directive.
- (141) This Directive creates new tasks for ENISA, thereby enhancing its role, and could also result in ENISA being required to carry out its existing tasks under Regulation (EU) 2019/881 to a higher level than before. In order to ensure that ENISA has the necessary financial and human resources to carry out existing and new tasks, as well as to meet any higher level of execution of those tasks resulting from its enhanced role, its budget should be increased accordingly. In addition, in order to ensure the efficient use of resources, ENISA should be given greater flexibility in the way that it is able to allocate resources internally for the purpose of effectively carrying out its tasks and meeting expectations.
