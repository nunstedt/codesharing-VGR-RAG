- 7. In  the  event  of  the  restriction,  suspension  or  withdrawal  of  a  designation,  the  notifying  authority  shall:
- (a) assess  the  impact  on  the  certificates  issued  by  the  notified  body;
- (b) submit a report on its findings to the Commission and the other Member States within three months of having notified the  changes  to  the  designation;
- (c) require the notified body to suspend or withdraw, within a reasonable period of time determined by the authority, any certificates  which  were  unduly  issued,  in  order  to  ensure  the  continuing  conformity  of  high-risk  AI  systems  on  the market;
- (d) inform the Commission and the Member States about certificates the suspension or withdrawal of which it has required;
- (e) provide  the  national  competent  authorities  of  the  Member  State  in  which  the  provider  has  its  registered  place  of business with all relevant information about the certificates of which it has required the suspension or withdrawal; that authority shall take the appropriate measures, where necessary, to avoid a potential risk to health, safety or fundamental rights.
- 8. With  the  exception  of  certificates  unduly  issued,  and  where  a  designation  has  been  suspended  or  restricted,  the certificates  shall  remain  valid  in  one  of  the  following  circumstances:
- (a) the notifying authority has confirmed, within one month of the suspension or restriction, that there is no risk to health, safety  or  fundamental  rights  in  relation  to  certificates  affected  by  the  suspension  or  restriction,  and  the  notifying authority  has  outlined  a  timeline  for  actions  to  remedy  the  suspension  or  restriction;  or
- (b) the notifying authority has confirmed that no certificates relevant to the suspension will be issued, amended or re-issued during the course of the suspension or restriction, and states whether the notified body has the capability of continuing to monitor and remain responsible for existing certificates issued for the period of the suspension or restriction; in the event  that  the  notifying  authority  determines  that  the  notified  body  does  not  have  the  capability  to  support  existing certificates  issued,  the  provider  of  the  system  covered  by  the  certificate  shall  confirm  in  writing  to  the  national competent authorities of the Member State in which it has its registered place of business, within three months of the suspension  or  restriction,  that  another  qualified  notified  body  is  temporarily  assuming  the  functions  of  the  notified body to monitor and remain responsible for  the certificates during the  period  of  suspension  or  restriction.
- 9. With the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a designation has been withdrawn, the certificates shall remain valid  for  a  period  of  nine  months  under  the  following  circumstances:
- (a) the national competent authority of the Member State in which the provider of the high-risk AI system covered by the certificate has its registered place of business has confirmed that there is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated  with  the  high-risk  AI  systems  concerned;  and
- (b) another  notified  body has confirmed in writing that it will assume immediate responsibility for  those AI systems and completes its  assessment  within  12  months  of  the  withdrawal  of  the  designation.
In the circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph, the national competent authority of the Member State in which the  provider  of  the  system  covered  by  the  certificate  has  its  place  of  business  may  extend  the  provisional  validity  of  the certificates  for  additional  periods  of  three  months,  which  shall  not  exceed  12  months  in  total.
The national competent authority or the notified body assuming the functions of the notified body affected by the change of  designation shall  immediately inform the Commission, the other Member States and the other  notified bodies thereof.
