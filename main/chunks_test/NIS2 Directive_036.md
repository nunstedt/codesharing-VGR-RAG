- 2. For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  1,  Member  States  shall  require  the  database  of  domain  name  registration  data  to contain  the  necessary  information  to  identify  and  contact  the  holders  of  the  domain  names  and  the  points  of  contact administering the domain names under the TLDs.

## CHAPTER VI
## INFORMATION SHARING
## Article 29
## Cybersecurity information-sharing arrangements
- 1. Member States shall ensure that entities falling within the scope of this Directive and, where relevant, other entities not falling within the scope of this Directive are able to exchange on a voluntary basis relevant cybersecurity information among themselves, including information relating to cyber threats, near misses, vulnerabilities, techniques and procedures, indicators of compromise, adversarial tactics, threat-actor-specific information, cybersecurity alerts and recommendations regarding configuration of cybersecurity tools to detect cyberattacks, where such information sharing:
- (a) aims to prevent, detect, respond to or recover from incidents or to mitigate their impact;
- (b) enhances  the  level  of  cybersecurity,  in  particular  through  raising  awareness  in  relation  to  cyber  threats,  limiting  or impeding the ability of such threats to spread, supporting a range of defensive capabilities, vulnerability remediation and  disclosure,  threat  detection,  containment  and  prevention  techniques,  mitigation  strategies,  or  response  and recovery stages or promoting collaborative cyber threat research between public and private entities.
- 2. Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  exchange  of  information  takes  place  within  communities  of  essential  and important entities, and where relevant, their suppliers or service providers. Such exchange shall be implemented through cybersecurity information-sharing arrangements in respect of the potentially sensitive nature of the information shared. - 3. Member  States  shall  facilitate  the  establishment  of  cybersecurity  information-sharing  arrangements  referred  to  in paragraph  2  of  this  Article.  Such  arrangements  may  specify  operational  elements,  including  the  use  of  dedicated  ICT platforms  and  automation  tools,  content  and  conditions  of  the  information-sharing  arrangements.  In  laying  down  the details  of  the  involvement  of  public  authorities  in  such  arrangements,  Member  States  may  impose  conditions  on  the information  made  available  by  the  competent  authorities  or  the  CSIRTs.  Member  States  shall  offer  assistance  for  the application of such arrangements in accordance with their policies referred to in Article 7(2), point (h).
- 4. Member  States  shall  ensure  that  essential and  important  entities notify the  competent  authorities  of their participation in the cybersecurity information-sharing arrangements referred to in paragraph 2, upon entering into such arrangements, or, as applicable, of their withdrawal from such arrangements, once the withdrawal takes effect.
- 5. ENISA shall provide assistance for the establishment of cybersecurity information-sharing arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 by exchanging best practices and providing guidance.
## Article 30
## Voluntary notification of relevant information
- 1. Member States shall ensure that, in addition to the notification obligation provided for in Article 23, notifications can be submitted to the CSIRTs or, where applicable, the competent authorities, on a voluntary basis, by:
- (a) essential and important entities with regard to incidents, cyber threats and near misses;
- (b) entities other than those referred to in point (a), regardless of whether they fall within the scope of this Directive, with regard to significant incidents, cyber threats and near misses.
- 2. Member  States  shall  process  the  notifications  referred  to  in  paragraph  1  of  this  Article  in  accordance  with  the procedure laid down in Article 23. Member States may prioritise the processing of mandatory notifications over voluntary notifications.
Where necessary, the CSIRTs and, where applicable, the competent authorities shall provide the  single  points of contact with  the  information  about  notifications  received  pursuant  to  this  Article,  while  ensuring  the  confidentiality  and appropriate  protection  of  the  information  provided  by  the  notifying  entity.  Without  prejudice  to  the  prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences, voluntary reporting shall not result in the imposition of any additional  obligations  upon  the  notifying  entity  to  which  it  would  not  have  been  subject  had  it  not  submitted  the notification.
## CHAPTER VII
## SUPERVISION AND ENFORCEMENT
## Article 31
## General aspects concerning supervision and enforcement
- 1. Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities effectively supervise and take the measures necessary to ensure compliance with this Directive.
- 2. Member  States  may  allow  their  competent  authorities  to  prioritise  supervisory  tasks.  Such  prioritisation  shall  be based on a risk-based approach. To that end, when exercising their supervisory tasks provided for in Articles 32 and 33, the competent authorities may establish supervisory methodologies allowing for a prioritisation of such tasks following a risk-based approach. - 3. The  competent  authorities  shall  work  in  close  cooperation  with  supervisory  authorities  under  Regulation  (EU) 2016/679 when addressing incidents resulting in personal data breaches, without prejudice to the competence and tasks of the supervisory authorities under that Regulation.
- 4. Without  prejudice  to  national  legislative  and  institutional  frameworks,  Member  States  shall  ensure  that,  in  the supervision  of  compliance  of  public  administration  entities  with  this  Directive  and  the  imposition  of  enforcement measures with regard to infringements of this Directive, the competent authorities have appropriate powers to carry out such  tasks  with  operational  independence  vis-à-vis  the  public  administration  entities  supervised.  Member  States  may decide on the imposition of appropriate, proportionate and effective supervisory and enforcement measures in relation to those entities in accordance with the national legislative and institutional frameworks.
## Article 32
## Supervisory and enforcement measures in relation to essential entities
- 1. Member States shall ensure that the supervisory or enforcement measures imposed on essential entities in respect of the obligations laid down  in  this Directive are effective, proportionate  and  dissuasive, taking into  account  the circumstances of each individual case.
- 2. Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  competent  authorities,  when  exercising  their  supervisory  tasks  in  relation  to essential entities, have the power to subject those entities at least to:
- (a) on-site inspections and off-site supervision, including random checks conducted by trained professionals;
- (b) regular and targeted security audits carried out by an independent body or a competent authority;
- (c) ad hoc audits, including where justified on the ground of a significant incident or an infringement of this Directive by the essential entity;
- (d) security  scans  based  on  objective,  non-discriminatory,  fair  and  transparent  risk  assessment  criteria,  where  necessary with the cooperation of the entity concerned;
- (e) requests  for  information  necessary  to  assess  the  cybersecurity  risk-management  measures  adopted  by  the  entity concerned,  including  documented  cybersecurity  policies,  as  well  as  compliance  with  the  obligation  to  submit information to the competent authorities pursuant to Article 27;
- (f) requests to access data, documents and information necessary to carry out their supervisory tasks;
- (g) requests for evidence of implementation of cybersecurity policies, such as the results of security audits carried out by a qualified auditor and the respective underlying evidence.
The targeted security audits referred to in the first subparagraph, point (b), shall be based on risk assessments conducted by the competent authority or the audited entity, or on other risk-related available information.
