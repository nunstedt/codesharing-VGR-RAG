The "Test" system is designed to facilitate the testing of new medicines. Its primary purpose is to support this crucial research and development activity. The system is used by internal staff at VGR, as well as external specialists who collaborate on the testing process. The system handles sensitive data, including both personal and health information. It operates within an on-premise environment and is accessible only through the internal network. Importantly, the "Test" system does not incorporate any artificial intelligence components. While important for operations, the system is classified as having a medium level of criticality, meaning its failure would have a noticeable operational impact.
